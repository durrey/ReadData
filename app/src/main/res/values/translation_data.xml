        <item>¹Praise belongs to Allah, ²the Lord of all the worlds

        <item>The All-Merciful, the Very-Merciful. ⁴</item>
        <item>The Master of the Day of Requital.</item>
        <item>You alone do we worship, and from You alone do we seek

        <item>Take us on the straight path ⁵</item>
        <item>The path of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace,⁶
Not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor of those who have gone

        <item>Alif. Lam. Mim . ¹</item>
        <item>This Book has no doubt in it - a guidance for the Godfearing,</item>
        <item>Who believe in the Unseen, ²and are steadfast in Salah
(prayer), ³and spend ⁴out of what We have provided them;</item>
        <item>And who believe in what has been revealed to you and
what has been revealed before you; ⁵and they have faith in the
Hereafter.</item>
        <item>It is these who are guided by their Lord; and it is just
these who are successful.</item>
        <item>Surely for those who have disbelieved, ⁶it is all the
same whether you warn them or you warn them not: they do not believe.
</item>
        <item>Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their
hearing; and on their eyes there is a covering, and for them awaits a
mighty punishment. ⁷</item>
        <item>And among men there are some who say, “We believe in
Allah and in the Last Day”, yet they are not believers. ⁸</item>
        <item>They try to deceive Allah and those who believe, while
they are not deceiving anyone except themselves, although they are
unaware of it.</item>
        <item>In their hearts there is a malady, so Allah has made
them grow in their malady; and for them there is a grievous
punishment, because they have been lying.</item>
        <item>When it is said to them, “Do not spread disorder on the
earth”, they say, “We are but reformers.”</item>
        <item>Beware, it is, in fact, they who spread disorder, but
they do not appreciate.</item>
        <item>And when it is said to them, “Believe as people have
believed,” they say, “Shall we believe as the fools have believed?”
Beware, it is, in fact, they who are the fools, but they do not know.
</item>
        <item>When they meet those who believe, they say, “We have
entered Faith;” but when they are alone with their satans, they say,
“Indeed, we are with you; we were only mocking.”</item>
        <item>It is Allah who mocks at them, and lets them go on
wandering blindly in their rebellion.</item>
        <item>These are the people who have bought error at the price
of guidance; so their trade has brought no gain, nor have they reached
the right Path.</item>
        <item>Their situation is like that of a man who kindles a
fire, and when it illuminates everything around him, Allah takes away
their lights and leaves them in layers of darkness, so that they see
nothing.</item>
        <item>Deaf, dumb and blind, they shall not return. ⁹</item>
        <item>Or (it is) like a rainstorm from the sky, bringing
darkness, thunder and lightning; they thrust their fingers in their
ears against the thunderclaps for fear of death, ___and Allah
encompasses the disbelievers__</item>
        <item>And lightning (all but) snatches away their eyesight;
every time a flash gives them light, they walk by it; and when
darkness falls upon them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He
would certainly take away their hearing and their eyes: surely Allah
is powerful to do anything.</item>
        <item>O people, worship your Lord who created you and those
before you, so that you may become God-fearing</item>
        <item>He is the One who made the earth a bed for you, and the
sky a roof, and sent down water from the sky, then brought forth with
it fruits, as a provision for you. So, do not set up parallels to
Allah when you know. ¹⁰</item>
        <item>If you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our
servant, ¹¹hen bring a Surah similar to this, and do call your
supporters other than Allah, if you are true.</item>
        <item>But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then
guard yourselves against the Fire, the fuel of which will be men and
stones. It has been prepared for disbelievers.</item>
        <item>And give good news to those who believe and do righteous
deeds that for them there are gardens beneath which rivers flow.
¹²very time they are given a fruit from there to eat, they will say,
“This is what we have been given before”; and they will be given
(fruits) resembling one another. ¹³nd for them there shall be wives
purified; and there they will live forever.</item>
        <item>Indeed, Allah does not feel shy in citing any parable,
be it that of a gnat or of something above it (in meanness). ¹⁴ow, as
for those who believe, they know it is the truth from their Lord;
while those who disbelieve say, “What could Allah have meant by this
parable?” By this He lets many go astray, and by this He makes many
find guidance. But He does not let anyone go astray thereby except
those who are sinful</item>
        <item>Those who break the Covenant of Allah after it has been
made binding, and cut off the relations Allah has commanded to be
joined, ¹⁵nd spread disorder on the earth - it is these who are the
losers.</item>
        <item>How is it that you deny Allah, while you were lifeless
and He gave you life; then He will make you die, and then He will make
you live again, and then to Him you will be returned?</item>
        <item>It is He who created for you all that the earth
contains; then He turned to the heavens and made them seven skies -
and He is the knower of all things.</item>
        <item>Remember) when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going
to create a deputy ¹⁶n the earth!” They said, “Will You create there
one who will spread disorder on the earth and cause bloodshed, while
we proclaim Your purity, along with your praise, and sanctify Your
name?” He said, “Certainly, I know what you know not.”</item>
        <item>And He taught ’Adam the names, all of them; then
presented them before the angels, and said, “Tell me their names, if
you are right.” ¹⁷</item>
        <item>They said, “To You belongs all purity! We have no
knowledge except what You have given us. Surely, You alone are the
All-knowing, All-wise.”</item>
        <item>He said, “O ’Adam, tell them the names of all these.”
When he told them their names, Allah said, “Did I not tell you that I
know the secrets of the skies and of the earth, and that I know what
you disclose and what you conceal</item>
        <item>And when We said to the angels: “Prostrate yourselves
before ’Adam!” So, they prostrated themselves, ¹⁸ll but Iblis (Satan).
He refused, showed arrogance and became one of the infidels.</item>
        <item>And We said, “O ’Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in
Paradise; and eat at pleasure wherever you like, but do not go near
this tree, otherwise youwill be (counted) among the
transgressors.”</item>
        <item>Then, Satan caused them to slip from it, and brought
them out of where they had been. And We said, “Go down, all of you,
some of you the enemies of others; ¹⁹nd on the earth there will be for
you a dwelling place and enjoyment for a time.”</item>
        <item>Then ’Adam learned certain words (to pray with) from his
Lord; so, Allah accepted his repentance. No doubt, He is the MostRelenting, the Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>We said, “Go down from here, all of you. Then, should
some guidance come to you from Me, those who follow My guidance shall
have no fear, nor shall they grieve.</item>
        <item>As for those who disbelieve, and deny Our signs, they
are the people of the Fire. They shall dwell in it forever.”</item>
        <item>O Children of Isra’il (the Israelites), remember My
blessing that I conferred upon you, and fulfill the covenant with Me,
and I shall fulfill your covenant, and have awe of Me alone.</item>
        <item>And have faith in what I have revealed, confirming what
is already with you, ²⁰nd do not be the first to deny it, nor take a
paltry price for My verses. Fear Me alone.</item>
        <item>And do not confound truth with falsehood, and do not
hide the truth when you know (it).</item>
        <item>And be steadfast in Salah (prayer), and pay Zakah, and
bow down with those who bow down.</item>
        <item>Do you enjoin righteousness upon others while you ignore
your own selves, although you keep reciting the Book? Have you then no
sense?</item>
        <item>Seek help through patience and prayer. It is indeed
exacting, but not for those who are humble in their hearts,</item>
        <item>Who bear in mind that they are to meet their Lord, and
that to Him they are to return.</item>
        <item>O Children of Isra’il (Israel), remember My blessing
that I conferred upon you, and that I gave you excellence over the
worlds;</item>
        <item>And guard yourselves against a day when no one shall
stand for anyone in anything, nor shall intercession be accepted on
anyone’s behalf, nor shall ransom be taken from him, and neither shall
any be given support.</item>
        <item>Remember) when We delivered you from the people of
Pharaoh! They had been inflicting on you grievous torment,
slaughtering your sons and leaving your women alive. In all that,
there was a great trial from your Lord.</item>
        <item>And (recall) when We parted the sea for you; then We
saved you, and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking
on!</item>
        <item>And when We appointed forty nights for Musa, ²¹hen you
took the calf (as God) thereafter, and you were unjust.</item>
        <item>Yet We pardoned you, even after that, so that you may
show gratitude.</item>
        <item>Then We gave Musa the Book and the Criterion (of right
and wrong), so that you may find the right path.</item>
        <item>When Musa said to his people: “My people, you have
wronged yourselves by your taking the calf (as God). So, turn in
repentance to your Creator, and slay yourselves. ²²That will be better
for you in the sight of your Creator”. Then, He accepted your
repentance. Indeed He is the Most-Relenting, the Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>When you said, “Musa, we will never believe you till we
see Allah openly!” ²³So, the thunderbolt took you while you were
looking on.</item>
        <item>Then, We raised you up after your death, so that you
might show gratitude.</item>
        <item>And We made the cloud give you shade, and sent down to
you Mann and Salwa: ²⁴“Eat of the good things We have provided to you”.
And they (by their ingratitude) did Us no harm, but were harming only
themselves.</item>
        <item>When We said, “Enter this town, and eat to your heart’s
content wherever you wish in it; and enter the gate prostrating
yourselves and say: Hittah (we seek forgiveness), so that We forgive
your errors. And We shall give much more to those who do good.”</item>
        <item>But those who were unjust substituted another word for
the one that was prescribed for them. ²⁵So, We sent down a scourge
²⁶from heaven upon those who were unjust, because they had acted
sinfully.</item>
        <item>When Musa sought water for his people, We said, “Strike
the rock with your staff,” And twelve springs gushed forth from it.
Each group of people came to know their drinking place. ²⁷“Eat and
drink of what Allah has provided, and do not go about the earth
spreading disorder.”</item>
        <item>And when you said, “Musa , we will no longer confine
ourselves to a single food: So, pray for us to your Lord that He may
bring forth for us of what the earth grows - of its vegetable, its
cucumbers, its wheat, its lentils and its onions.” He said, “Do you
want to take what is inferior in exchange for what is better? Go down
to a town, and you will have what you ask for.” ²⁸ Then they were
stamped with disgrace and misery, and they returned with wrath from
Allah. That was becau</item>
        <item>Surely, those who believed in Allah, and those who are
Jews, and Christians, and Sabians, ²⁹__whosoever believes in Allah and
in the Last Day, and does good deeds - all such people will have their
reward with their Lord, ³⁰and there will be no reason for them to fear,
nor shall they grieve.</item>
        <item>And when We took the pledge from you, and raised high
above you the (Mount of) Tur: ³¹Hold fast to what We have given to
you, and remember what is in it, so that you may become Godfearing.”</item>
        <item>Then even after that, you turned away. So, had it not
been for the grace of Allah upon you, and His mercy, you would have
been among the losers.</item>
        <item>Certainly you have knowledge of those among you who
transgressed in (the matter of) the Sabbath. We said to them, “Become
apes, abased.” ³²</item>
        <item>Thus, We made it a deterrent for those around and (those
who came) after them - and a lesson for the God-fearing.</item>
        <item>When Musa said to his people, “Allah commands you to
slaughter a cow”, they said, “Are you making fun of us?” He said, “I
seek refuge with Allah from being one of the ignorant.”</item>
        <item>They said, “Pray for us to your Lord that He makes it
clear to us what sort (of cow) should she be.” He said, “He says she
should be a cow neither too old, nor too young - of some middle age in
between. Now, do what you are being asked to do.”</item>
        <item>They said, “Pray for us to your Lord that He makes it
clear to us of what colour it should be.” He said: “He says that she
should be a yellow cow, rich yellow in her colour that should please
the onlookers.”</item>
        <item>They said, “Pray for us to your Lord that He makes it
clear to us of what sort should she be, for this cow has made us
confused and, if Allah wills, We shall certainly take the right
course.”</item>
        <item>He said, “He says that it should be a cow which is not
tractable for tilling the soil or in watering the fields, (and it
should be) sound and without blemish.” They said, “Now, you have come
up with the right description.” Then they slaughtered her, although it
appeared that they would not do it.</item>
        <item>And when you killed a man, and started putting the blame
for it on one another, while Allah was to bring forth what you were
holding back.</item>
        <item>So, We said, “Strike him with a part of it.” ³³his is
how Allah revives the dead; and He shows you His signs, so that you
may understand.</item>
        <item>When, even after that, your hearts were hardened, as if
they were rocks, or still worse in hardness. For surely among the
rocks there are some from which rivers gush forth, and there are
others that crack open and water flows from them, and there are still
others that fall down in fear of Allah. ³⁴And Allah is not unaware of
what you do.</item>
        <item>O Muslims) do you still fancy that they will believe
you, although a group of them used to hear the word of Allah, and
then, having understood it, used to distort it knowingly?</item>
        <item>When they meet those who believe, they say, “We
believe.” But when some of them meet others in private, they say, “Do
you tell them (the Muslims) what Allah has disclosed to you so that
they may thereby argue against you before your Lord? ³⁵ill you, then,
not use reason?”</item>
        <item>Are they not aware that Allah knows what they conceal
and what they reveal?</item>
        <item>And some among them are illiterate who have no knowledge
of the Book, but have some fancies and do nothing but conjecture.
</item>
        <item>So, woe to those who write the Book with their hands and
then say, “This is from Allah”, so that they may gain thereby a
trifling price. Then, woe to them for what their hands have written,
and woe to them for what they earn.</item>
        <item>They say, “The fire shall not touch us for more than a
few days.” Say, “Have you taken a pledge from Allah, and Allah will
not go against His promise? Or, do you say about Allah what you do not
know?”</item>
        <item>Why not? Those who commit evil and are besieged by their
sins, ³⁶hose are people of the Fire - there they shall live forever.
</item>
        <item>As for those who believe, and do good deeds, they are
the people of Paradise - there they will live forever.</item>
        <item>Remember) when We took a pledge from the children of
Isra’il (Israel): “You shall not worship anyone other than Allah; and
you shall do good to the parents, and to near of kin, and to orphans
and the needy. And say to the people what is good, and be steadfast in
Salah (prayer), and pay Zakah .” Then, you went back (on your word),
all but a few among you, and you are used to turning away.</item>
        <item>When We took a pledge from you: “You shall not shed the
blood of one another, and you shall not drive one another out of your
homes.” Then you agreed, being yourselves the witnesses.</item>
        <item>Yet, here you are, killing one another, and driving a
group of your own people out of their homes, supporting each other
against them in sin and aggression - and if they come to you as
prisoners, you would ransom them, while their very expulsion was
unlawful for you! ³⁷Do you, then, believe in some parts of the Book,
and disbelieve in others? So, what can be the punishment of those
among you who do that, except disgrace in present life? And, on the
Day of Judgement, they shall be</item>
        <item>Those are the ones who bought the worldly life at the
cost of the Hereafter. So, punishment shall not be lightened for them,
nor shall they be helped.</item>
        <item>Indeed, We gave Musa the Book, and after him We sent
messengers, one following the other; and We gave clear signs to ‘Isa,
the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary), and supported him with the
Holy Spirit. ³⁸hen, how is it that every time a prophet came to you
with what does not meet your desires, you grew arrogant? So, you gave
the lie to a group (of the messengers) and killed others.</item>
        <item>And they said, “Our hearts are veiled.” Rather, Allah
has cast damnation upon them for their disbelief. So, they believe
just in very little things. ³⁹</item>
        <item>And when there came to them a Book from Allah, which
confirms what was with them,__ while earlier, they used to seek help
against those who disbelieved, ⁴⁰_ yet when there came to them that
which they did recognize, they denied it. So the curse of Allah is
upon the disbelievers.</item>
        <item>Vile is that for which they have sold out their selves:
that they should deny what Allah has revealed, grudging that Allah
should send down some of His bounty to whomsoever He wills from among
His servants. ⁴¹o, they came out with wrath upon wrath. And for the
unbelievers, there is humiliating punishment.</item>
        <item>When it is said to them, “Believe in what Allah has
revealed,” they say, “We believe in what has been revealed to us” -
and they deny what is beyond it, whereas that is the truth which
confirms what is with them. Say, “Why then have you been slaying the
prophets of Allah earlier, if you were believers?”</item>
        <item>And certainly Musa came to you with clear signs, then
you adopted the calf (as god) after his departure (to the mount of
Tur) - and you were transgressors.</item>
        <item>And when We took a pledge from you, and raised high the
(mount of) Tur above you: ⁴²“Hold fast to what We have given you, and
listen”! They said, “We have heard and disobeyed.” And, on account of
their denial, they were soaked with love for the calf in their hearts.
Say: “Evil is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you are
believers.”</item>
        <item>Say: “If the Last Abode near Allah is purely for you, to
the exclusion of all people, then make a wish for death, if you are
true.”</item>
        <item>But they will never wish for it because of what their
hands have sent ahead. Allah is All-Aware of the unjust.</item>
        <item>You shall surely find them the more avid, for life than
all other men - even more than the polytheists. Every one of them
would love that his life is prolonged for one thousand years. But it
will not take him away from punishment that his life is (so)
prolonged, and Allah is watchful of what they do.</item>
        <item>Say, if someone is an enemy to Jibra’il (Gabriel) (it
can by no means degrade him for) it is he who has brought it (the
Qur’an) down upon your heart by the permission of Allah, ⁴³confirming
what has been before it, and a guidance and good tidings to the
believers.</item>
        <item>If someone is an enemy to Allah, His angels, and His
messengers, and to Jibra’il (Gabriel) and Mika’il (Michael), then
Allah is enemy to the disbelievers.</item>
        <item>And certainly We have revealed to you clear signs. And
no one denies them except the sinful.</item>
        <item>Would it always be that every time they enter into a
pact, a group from among them should throw it aside? In fact, most of
them do not believe.</item>
        <item>And when a messenger from Allah came to them, confirming
what was already with them, some from among the people of the Book
threw the Book of Allah behind their backs, as if they did not know.
</item>
        <item>They followed what the devils used to recite in the
reign of Sulaiman (Solomon); ⁴⁴and it was not Sulaiman who became an
infidel, but the devils did become infidels, ⁴⁵teaching people magic,
and what had been sent down to the two angels, Harut and Marut, in
Babylon. And these two did not teach anyone without first having said
(to him), “We are but a trial, so do not go infidel.” ⁴⁶Then, they used
to learn from them that with which they could cause</item>
        <item>And had they accepted the faith, and been God-fearing,
the reward from Allah would have always been far better. If only they
knew!</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not say Ra‘ina, but say Unzurna,
⁴⁷nd listen, as there is a grievous punishment for the unbelievers.
</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieve from among the people of the Book
and the idolaters do not like that any good should come to you from
your Lord. But Allah chooses for His grace whomsoever He wills, and
Allah is the Lord of great bounty.</item>
        <item>Whenever We abrogate a verse or cause it to be
forgotten, We bring one better than it or one equal to it. ⁴⁸o you not
know that Allah is powerful over everything?</item>
        <item>Do you not know that to Allah alone belongs the kingdom
of the heavens and the earth? Other than Allah, you have neither a
patron, nor a helper.</item>
        <item>Or, do you rather want to question your Prophet as Musa
was questioned earlier? ⁴⁹And whoever takes infidelity in exchange for
faith has certainly missed the straight path.</item>
        <item>O Muslims,) many among the people of the Book desire to
turn you, after your accepting the faith, back into disbelievers - all
out of envy on their part, even after the truth has become clear to
them. So, forgive and overlook till Allah brings out His command.
Certainly, Allah is powerful over everything.</item>
        <item>And be steadfast in Salah (prayer), and give Zakah.
Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with
Allah. Certainly, Allah is watchful of what you do.</item>
        <item>They say that no one shall ever enter Paradise unless he
is a Jew, or a Christian. These are their fancies. Say, “Bring your
proof, if you are truthful.”</item>
        <item>Of course, whosoever submits his face to Allah, and is
good in deeds, will have his reward with his Lord, and there shall be
no fear for such people, nor shall they grieve.</item>
        <item>The Jews say: “The Christians have nothing to stand on”
and the Christians say “The Jews have nothing to stand on” while they
both read the Book! Similarly, those who do not know ⁵⁰ave said like
they (the Jews and the Christians) say. So, Allah will judge between
them on the Day of Resurrection in what they used to dispute.</item>
        <item>Who is more cruel than the one who prevents the mosques
of Allah from His name being recited therein, and strives for their
destruction? ⁵¹t was not for such men to enter them except in awe. For
them there is disgrace in this world, and for them there is a mighty
punishment in the other world.</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs the East and the West. So, whichever
way you turn, there is the Face of Allah. ⁵²ndeed, Allah is AllEmbracing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>They say: “Allah has got a son.” Pure is He. Instead, to
Him belongs all that there is in the heavens and the earth. All stand
obedient to Him. ⁵³</item>
        <item>He is the) Originator of the heavens and the earth. When
He decides a matter, He simply says to it: “Be”, and it comes to be.
</item>
        <item>Those who do not know say: “Why is it that Allah does
not speak to us, nor does a sign come to us?” So spoke those before
them as these people do. Their hearts resemble each other. We have
indeed made the signs clear for the people who have certitude.</item>
        <item>Surely, We have sent you with the truth, as a bearer of
good tidings, and a warner, and you will not be asked about the people
of Hell.</item>
        <item>The Jews will never be pleased with you, nor will the
Christians, unless you follow their faith. Say: “Guidance of Allah is,
indeed, the guidance.” Were you to follow their desires despite the
knowledge that has come to you, there shall be no friend for you
against Allah, nor a helper.</item>
        <item>Those to whom We have given the Book and they recite it
observing the rights of its recitation - ⁵⁴they are the ones who
believe in it. And those who disbelieve in it, they are the losers.
</item>
        <item>O children of Isra’il (Israel), remember My blessing
that I conferred upon you, and that I gave you excellence over the
worlds.</item>
        <item>And guard yourselves against a day when no one shall
stand for anyone for anything, nor shall ransom be accepted from
anyone, nor shall intercession be of benefit to him, nor shall any
support be given to such people.</item>
        <item>⁵⁵hen his Lord put Ibrahim to a test with certain Words,
and he fulfilled them, He said, “I am going to make you an Imam for
the people.” ⁵⁶He said, “And from among my progeny?” He replied, “My
promise does not extend to the unjust.”</item>
        <item>⁵⁷When We made the House (Ka‘bah of Makkah) a frequented
place for men, and a place of peace! ⁵⁸ake from the Station of Ibrahim

Isma‘il (Ishmael): “Purify My House for those whoare to circumambulate
(make Tawaf) ⁶⁰and those who stay in I‘tikaf, and those who bow down or
prostrate themselves (in prayers).</item>
        <item>Recall) when Ibrahim said, “My Lord, make this a city of
peace, and provide its people with fruits - those of them who believe
in Allah and the Last Day.” He (Allah) said, “As for the one who
disbelieves, I shall let him enjoy a little, then I shall drag him to
the punishment of the Fire. How evil an end it is!</item>
        <item>When Ibrahim was raising up the foundations of the
House, along with Isma‘il (Ishmael) (supplicating): “Our Lord accept
(this service) from us! Indeed, You - and You alone - are the AllHearing, the All-Knowing!</item>
        <item>Our Lord, make us both submissive to You, and (make) of
our progeny as well, a people submissive to You and show us our ways
of Pilgrimage and accept our repentance. Indeed, You - and You alone -
are the Most-Relenting, the Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>And, our Lord, raise in their midst a Messenger ⁶¹rom
among them, who should recite to them Your verses, and teach them the
Book and the wisdom, and cleanse them of all impurities. Indeed You,
and You alone, are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”</item>
        <item>Who can turn away from the faith of Ibrahim except the
one who has debased himself in folly? Indeed We have chosen him in
this world. And he is certainly among the righteous in the Hereafter.
</item>
        <item>When his Lord said to him, “Submit!” He said, “I submit
myself to the Lord of all the worlds.”</item>
        <item>And Ibrahim exhorted the same to his sons, and so did
Ya‘qub (Jacob): “My sons, Allah has certainly chosen for you the
Faith. So, let not death overtake you but as Muslims.”</item>
        <item>Is it that you were present when death approached
Ya‘qub, when he said to his sons: “What will you worship after me”?
They said, “We will worship your God and the God of your fathers,
Ibrahim, Isma‘il (Ishmael) and Ishaq (Isaac), the one God, and to Him
we submit ourselves.”</item>
        <item>Those are a people who have passed away. For them is
what they earned, and for you is what you earned. Nor shall you be
questioned as to what they have been doing.</item>
        <item>They said, “Become Jews or Christians, and you will find
the right path.” Say: “Instead, (we follow) the faith of Ibrahim, the
upright, ⁶²- and he was not one of those who associate partners with
Allah.”</item>
        <item>Say (O, Muslims): “We believe in Allah, and in what has
been revealed to us, and in what has been revealed to Ibrahim, Isma‘il
(Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), Ya‘qub and his children, and in what has
been given to Musa and ‘Isa (Jesus) and what has been given to the
prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between any of them,
and to Him we submit ourselves.”</item>
        <item>So, if they believe in the same way as you believe, they
will have certainly found the right path, and if they turn away, then
the fact is that they are in antagonism. Then Allah will suffice you
against them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>We dye ourselves with) the colouring of Allah! For who
is better in colouring than Allah? ⁶³e are to worship none but Him.
</item>
        <item>Say: “Would you argue with us about Allah, when He is
our Lord as well as your Lord? For us our deeds, and for you your
deeds! And we are faithful to Him.</item>
        <item>Or, would you say that Ibrahim, Isma‘il, Ishaq, Ya‘qub
and their children were Jews or Christians?” Say: “Do you know better
or does Allah?” Who can be more unjust than the one who conceals the
testimony he has from Allah? Allah is not unaware of what you do.
</item>
        <item>Those are a people who have passed away. For them is
what they earned, and for you is what you earned, and you shall not be
questioned about what they have been doing.</item>
        <item>The foolish among the people will say: “What has turned
them away from their Qiblah which they used to observe?” ⁶⁴ay: “To
Allah belong the East and the West. He guides whom He wills to a
straight path.”</item>
        <item>In the same way We made you a moderate Ummah
(community), ⁶⁵so that you should be witnesses over the people, and the
Messenger a witness to you. ⁶⁶nd We did not prescribe the Qiblah which
you used to observe except to know the one who follows the Messenger
as distinct from the one who turns on his heels. ⁶⁷t was burdensome
indeed, but not on those whom Allah guided. Allah will not allow your
faith go to waste. ⁶⁸Certainly Allah</item>
        <item>We have been seeing you turning your face to the
heavens. ⁶⁹o, We will certainly assign to you a Qiblah that you would
like. Now, turn your face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque (AlMasjid-ul-Haram), and (O Muslims), wherever you are, turn your faces
in its direction. Even those who have been given the Book ⁷⁰now well
that it is the truth from their Lord, and Allah is not unaware of what
they do.</item>
        <item>Even if you bring every sign to those who have been
given the Book, they would not follow your Qiblah, and you are not to
follow their Qiblah, ⁷¹or are they to follow each other’s Qiblah. If
you were to follow their desires despite the knowledge that has come
to you, you will then certainly be among the unjust.</item>
        <item>Those whom We have given the Book recognize him (the
Holy Prophet (S.A.W)) as they recognize their own sons. ⁷²n fact, a
group of them conceals the truth, while they know (it).</item>
        <item>The truth is from your Lord. So, never be among those
who doubt (it).”</item>
        <item>For everyone there is a direction to which he turns his
face. Strive, then, to excel each other in good deeds. Wherever you
are, Allah will bring you all together. ⁷³Allah is certainly powerful
over everything.</item>
        <item>From wherever you set out, turn your face in the
direction of the Sacred Mosque (Al-Masjid-ul-Haram). That, indeed, is
the truth from your Lord, and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
</item>
        <item>And from wherever you set out, turn your face in the
direction of the Sacred Mosque (Al-Masjid-ul-Haram), and (O Muslims),
wherever you are, turn your faces in its direction, so that people
should have no argument against you, ⁷⁴xcept for those among them who
are unjust,__ do not fear them, but fear Me__, and so that I should
perfect My blessings upon you, and that you may take the right path.
</item>
        <item>As also We have sent in your midst a messenger from
among you, ⁷⁵ho recites to you Our verses, and purifies you, and
teaches you the Book and the wisdom, and teaches you what you did not
know.</item>
        <item>So Remember Me, and I will remember you, and be thankful
to Me, and be not ungrateful to Me.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, seek help through patience and
prayer. ⁷⁶urely, Allah is with those who are patient.</item>
        <item>Do not say of those who are slain in the way of Allah
that they are dead. Instead, they are alive, but you do not perceive.
</item>
        <item>Surely We will test you with a bit of fear and hunger,
and loss in wealth and lives and fruits, and give good tidings to the
patient</item>
        <item>Who, when a suffering visits them, say: “We certainly
belong to Allah, and to Him we are bound to return.” ⁷⁷</item>
        <item>Those are the ones upon whom there are blessings from
their Lord, and mercy as well; and those are the ones who are on the
right path.</item>
        <item>Indeed Safa and Marwah ⁷⁸re among the marks of Allah.So
whoever comes to the House for Hajj or performs ‘Umrah, ⁷⁹here is no
sin for him if he makes rounds between them; ⁸⁰whoever comes up with
good on his own, then Allah is Appreciating, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who conceal the clear signs and the
guidance We have revealed, even after We have explained them for
people in the Book, upon them Allah casts damnation, and they are
cursed by all those who curse.</item>
        <item>Yet, those who repent and correct and declare (what they
used to conceal), their repentance is accepted by Me. I am the MostRelenting, the Most-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Indeed, those who disbelieved and died while they were
disbelievers, upon them is the curse of Allah, and of angels, and of
all human beings together,</item>
        <item>In a way that they will remain in it forever. Neither
the punishment will be lightened for them, nor will they be given
respite.</item>
        <item>Your god is one God: There is no god but He, the AllMerciful, the Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Surely, in the creation of heavens and earth, and the
alternation of night and day, and the ships that sail in the sea,
carrying that which benefits men, and in the water Allah sent down
from the sky, then revived with it the earth after it was dead, and in
every creature He has scattered on it, and in turning of winds, and in
the clouds employed to serve between heaven and earth, there are signs
for those who have sense.</item>
        <item>Among the people there are some who set up co-gods
beside Allah whom they love like the love due to Allah. But those who
believe are most firm in their love for Allah. Would that the unjust
people could perceive - when they see the torment (i.e. any calamity
in this world) - that all power belongs to Allah alone, and that Allah
is severe in punishment! ⁸¹</item>
        <item>Imagine the time) when those who were followed will
disown their followers, and they (all) will see the punishment, and
the bonds between them will be cut asunder, ⁸²</item>
        <item>And those who followed will say, “We wish we had another
(chance to) return (to the world), so that we may disown them as they
had disowned us.” Thus Allah will show them that their deeds were
(nothing but) causes of remorse for them, and they are not to come out
of the Fire.</item>
        <item>O people, eat permissible good things out of what lies
in the earth, and do not follow the footsteps of Shaitan (Satan);
⁸³ndeed, he is an open enemy for you.</item>
        <item>He orders you only to (do) evil and immodest acts, and
that you ascribe to Allah what you do not know.</item>
        <item>When it is said to them: “Follow what Allah has sent
down,” they say: “Instead, we would follow that (religion) on which we
have found our fathers.” Is it so, even though their fathers had no
understanding at all, nor had they been on the right path?</item>
        <item>The example of (calling) those who disbelieve is such as
someone is shouting at an animal that hears nothing but a call and
cry. ⁸⁴They are deaf, dumb and blind, so they do not understand.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, eat of the good things We have
provided to you and be grateful to Allah, if it is He whom you worship
(in real terms).</item>
        <item>He has only prohibited for you carrion, blood, the flesh
of swine and that upon which a name of someone other than ‘Allah’ has
been invoked. ⁸⁵Then, whoever is compelled by necessity, neither
seeking pleasure nor transgressing, there is no sin on him. ⁸⁶Verily,
Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Verily, those who conceal the Book Allah has revealed,
and earn thereby a small price, they eat nothing into their bellies
but fire, and Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Judgment, nor
will He purify them, and for them there is painful punishment.</item>
        <item>They are those who have bought the wrong way at the
price of the right way, and punishment at the price of pardon. How
well they endure the Fire!</item>
        <item>All that is because Allah revealed the Book with the
truth. Yet, those who have opted for dissension about the Book are in
extreme division (among themselves)</item>
        <item>Righteousness is not (merely) that you turn your faces
to the East and the West; ⁸⁷ut righteousness is that one believes in
Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the Book and the Prophets,
and gives wealth, despite (his) love for it, to relatives, and to
orphans, the helpless,the wayfarer, and to those who ask, and (spends)
in (freeing) slaves and observes the Salah (prayers) and pays
Zakah___and (the act of) those who fulfill their covenant when they
enter into a covenant, and, of course, ⁸⁸ those who are patient in
hardship and suffering and when in battle! Those are the ones who are
truthful, and those are the God-fearing.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, Qisas ⁸⁹ has been prescribed for you
in the case of murdered people: The freeman (will be killed) for the
freeman, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.
⁹⁰However, if one is somewhat forgiven by his brother, the recourse (of
the latter) is to pursue the former (for blood money) with fairness,
and the obligation (of the former) is to pay (it) to the latter in a
nice way. ⁹¹ That is a relief from your Lord, and a mercy. So, whoever
transgresses after all that will have a painful punishment. ⁹²</item>
        <item>There is life for you in Qisas, O people of wisdom, ⁹³ so
that you may refrain (from killing).</item>
        <item>It is enjoined upon you, when death approaches any one
of you and he leaves some wealth, that he must bequeath for the
parents and the nearest of kin in the approved manner, being an
obligation on the God-fearing. ⁹⁴</item>
        <item>Then, whoever changes it after he has heard it, its sin
will only be on those who change it. ⁹⁵urely, Allah is All-hearing,
All-knowing.</item>
        <item>But, whoever apprehends a mistake (unintentional) or a
sin (intentional) from a testator, and puts things right between them,
then there is no sin on him. ⁹⁶urely, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
</item>
        <item>O you who believe, the fasts have been enjoined upon you
as they were enjoined upon those before you, so that you may be Godfearing,</item>
        <item>For days few in number. However, should any one of you
be sick or on a journey, then (he should fast) a number of other days
(equal to the missed ones); and those who have the strength, (still,
they do not opt for fasting,) on them there is a fidyah
(compensation), that is, the feeding of a poor person. ⁹⁷Then whoever
does good voluntarily, that is better for him. ⁹⁸However, that you fast
is better for you, if you only knew.</item>
        <item>The month of Ramadan is the one in which the Qur’an was
revealed ⁹⁹as guidance for mankind, and as clear signs that show the
right way and distinguish between right and wrong. So those of you who
witness the month must fast in it. But the one who is sick, or is on a
journey (should fast) as much from other days (as he missed). Allah
intends (to provide) ease for you and does not intend (to create)
hardship for you. All this is so that you may complete the number (of
fasts as prescribed) and proclaim the TakbÍr of Allah for having
guided you, and [so] that you may be grateful.¹⁰⁰</item>
        <item>When My servants ask you about Me, then (tell them that)
I am near. I respond to the call of one when he prays to Me; so they
should respond to Me, and have faith in Me, so that they may be on the
right path.</item>
        <item>It is made lawful for you, in the nights of fasts, to
have sex with your women. They are apparel for you, and you are
apparel for them. Allah knows that you have been betraying yourselves,
so He relented towards you and pardoned you. ¹⁰¹So now you can have
sexual intimacy with them and seek what Allah has destined for you and
eat and drink until the white thread of the dawn becomes distinct from
the black thread; then complete the fast up to the night. But do not
have sexual intimacy with them while you are staying in mosques for
I‘tikÉf. These are the limits set by Allah, so do not go near them.
Thus Allah manifests His signs to the people, so that they may be Godfearing.</item>
        <item>Do not eat up each other’s property by false means, nor
approach with it the authorities to eat up a portion of the property
of the people sinfully, while you know (that you are unjust in doing
so).</item>
        <item>They ask you about the new moons. Say: They are
indicative of time for the people, and of the Hajj. It is not
righteousness that you come into your houses from their backs, ¹⁰²but
righteousness is that one fears Allah. So come into houses through
their doors; and fear Allah so that you may be successful.</item>
        <item>Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight you,
and do not transgress. Verily, Allah does not like the transgressors.
</item>
        <item>Kill them wherever you find them, and drive them out
from where they drove you out, as Fitnah (to create disorder) is more
severe than killing. However, do not fight them near Al-Masjid-ulHaram (the Sacred Mosque in Makkah) unless they fight you there.
However, if they fight you (there) you may kill them. Such is the
reward of the disbelievers.</item>
        <item>But if they desist, then indeed, Allah is MostForgiving, Very- Merciful.</item>
        <item>Fight them until there is no Fitnah any more, and
obedience remains for Allah. But, if they desist, then aggression is
not allowed except against the transgressors.</item>
        <item>The holy month for the holy month, and the sanctities
are subject to retribution. So when anyone commits aggression against
you, be aggressive against him in the like manner as he did against
you, and fear Allah, and be sure that Allah is with the God-fearing.
</item>
        <item>Spend in the way of Allah and do not put yourselves into
destruction, and do good. Of course, Allah loves those who do good.
</item>
        <item>Accomplish the Hajj and the ‘Umrah for Allah, but if you
are restricted, then (sacrifice) whatever animal of offering is
available, and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its
place. ¹⁰³ But if anyone of you is ill, or has some trouble with his
scalp, then there is a ransom through fasting or alms giving. ¹⁰⁴ And
when you are safe, then, whoever avails the advantage of the ‘Umrah
along with the Hajj ¹⁰⁵ shall make an offering of whatever animal is
available. However, any one who finds none shall fast for three days
during Ùajj, and for seven days when you return; thus they are ten in
all. This is for him whose family folk are not residents of Al-Masjidul-ÙarÉm.¹⁰⁶ Fear Allah and be aware that Allah is severe in
punishment.</item>
        <item>The Hajj is (to be performed in) the months that are
well-known. So whoever undertakes Hajj in them, there should be no
obscenity, no sin, no quarrel in the Hajj. Whatever good you do, Allah
will know it. Take provisions along, for the merit of (having)
provision is to abstain (from begging), ¹⁰⁷ and fear Me, O men of
understanding!</item>
        <item>There is no sin on you that you seek the grace of your
Lord (by trading). ¹⁰⁸ Later, when you flow down from ‘Arafat, recite
the name of Allah near Al-Mash‘ar-ul-Haram (the Sacred Monument), ¹⁰⁹
and recite His name as He has guided you, while before it, you were
among the astray.</item>
        <item>Then flow down from where the people flow, and seek
forgiveness from Allah. Certainly Allah is Most-Forgiving, VeryMerciful.</item>
        <item>Once you have fulfilled your modes of worship in Hajj,
recite the name of Allah, as you would speak of your forefathers or
even with greater fervor. Now among the people there is one who says:
“Our Lord, give to us in this world...” and he has no share in the
Hereafter.</item>
        <item>Yet there is another among them who says: “Our Lord,
give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and save us from
the punishment of Fire.”</item>
        <item>For them there is a share of what they have earned; and
Allah is swift at reckoning.</item>
        <item>Recite the name of Allah during the given number of
days. ¹¹⁰ Then whoever is early in leaving after two days, there is no
sin on him, and whoever leaves later, there is no sin on him, if he is
God-fearing. Fear Allah and be sure that you are going to be gathered
before him.</item>
        <item>Among men there is one whose speech, in this life,
attracts you; he even makes Allah his witness on what is in his heart,
while he is extremely quarrelsome. ¹¹¹</item>
        <item>Once he turns back, he moves about in the land trying to
spread disorder in it, and to destroy the tillage and the stock; and
Allah does not like disorder.</item>
        <item>When it is said to him, “Fear Allah”, he is tempted by
arrogance to (commit) sin. Hell is then enough for him, and it is
indeed an evil bed to rest.</item>
        <item>And among men there is one who sells his very soul to
seek the pleasure of Allah, and Allah is Very-Kind to His servants.
</item>
        <item>O you who believe, enter Islam completely, and do not
follow the footsteps of Satan. Surely, he is an open enemy for you;
</item>
        <item>And if you slip, even after clear signs have come to
you, then you must know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.</item>
        <item>They are looking for nothing (to accept the truth) but
that Allah (Himself) comes upon them in canopies of cloud with angels,
and the matter is closed. To Allah shall all matters be returned.
</item>
        <item>Ask the Children of Isra’il (Israel) how many a clear
sign We have given to them; and whoever changes the blessing of Allah
after it has come to him, then Allah is severe in punishment.</item>
        <item>Adorned is the present life for those who disbelieve,
and they laugh at those who believe, while those who fear Allah shall
be above them on the Day of Resurrection. Allah gives provision to
whom He wills without measure.</item>
        <item>All men used to be a single ’Ummah (i.e. on a single
faith). Then (after they differed in matters of faith), Allah sent
prophets carrying good news and warning, and sent down with them the
Book with Truth to judge between people in matters of their dispute.
But it was no other than those to whom it (the Book) was given who,
led by envy against each other, disputed it after the clear signs had
come to them. Then Allah, by His will, guided those who believed to
the truth over which they disputed; and Allah guides whom He wills to
the straight path.</item>
        <item>Do you think that you will enter Paradise while you have
not yet been visited by (difficult) circumstances like those that were
faced by the people who passed away before you? They were afflicted by
hardship and suffering, and were so shaken down that the prophet, and
those who believed with him, started saying: “When (will come) the
help of Allah?” (Then, they were comforted by the Prophet who said to
them) ‘Behold, the help of Allah is near.’</item>
        <item>They ask you as to what they should spend. ¹¹² Say:
“Whatever good you spend should be for parents, kinsmen, orphans, the
needy and the wayfarer; and whatever good you do, Allah is all-aware
of it.”</item>
        <item>Fighting is enjoined upon you, while it is hard on you.
It could be that you dislike something, when it is good for you; and
it could be that you like something when it is bad for you. Allah
knows, and you do not know.</item>
        <item>They ask you about the Sacred Month, that is, about
fighting in it. ¹¹³ Say, “Fighting in it is something grave, but it is
much more grave, in the sight of Allah, to prevent (people) from the
path of Allah, to disbelieve in Him, and in Al-Masjid-ul-Haram, and to
expel its people from there, and Fitnah (to create disorder) is more
grave than killing.” They will go on fighting you until they turn you
away from your faith if they could, while whoever of you turns away
from his faith</item>
        <item>As for those who believed and those who migrated and
carried out Jihad in the way of Allah, they hope for Allah’s mercy:
and Allah is Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>They ask you about wine and gambling. Say, “In both
there is great sin, and some benefits for people. And their sin is
greater than their benefit.” And they ask you as to what they should
spend. Say, “The surplus”. ¹¹⁴ This is how Allah makes His verses clear
to you, so that you may ponder</item>
        <item>On this world and the Hereafter. They ask you about the
orphans. Say, “To work for their good is good. ¹¹⁵ And if you live with
them jointly, they are, after all, your brethren.”; and Allah knows
the one who makes mischief, as distinct from the one who promotes
good. And if Allah had wished, He would have put you in trouble.
Surely, Allah is Mighty, Wise.</item>
        <item>Do not marry the polytheist women, unless they come to
believe (in Islam); a Muslim slave-girl is better than a polytheist
woman, even though she may attract you; and do not give (your women)
in marriage to polytheist men, unless they come to believe; a Muslim
slave is better than a polytheist, even though he may attract you.
They invite to the Fire when Allah invites, by His will, to Paradise,
and to forgiveness. He makes His verses clear to the people, so that
they may heed the advice.</item>
        <item>They ask you about menstruation. Say: “It is an
impurity. So, keep away from women ¹¹⁶ During menstruation; and do not
have intimacy with them until they are cleansed. But when they are
cleansed, then go to them from where Allah has commanded you. Surely
Allah loves those who are most repenting, and loves those who keep
themselves pure.</item>
        <item>Your women are tillage for you to cultivate. So, come to
your tillage from where you wish, ¹¹⁷ and advance something for
yourselves, ¹¹⁸ and fear Allah, and know that you are to meet Him, and
give good news to the believers.”</item>
        <item>Do not make (the name of) Allah the subject of your
oaths against your doing good, fearing Allah and setting things right
between people. ¹¹⁹ Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Allah does not hold you accountable for what is laghw
(ineffectual) in your oaths, ¹²⁰ But He holds you accountable for what
your hearts have produced. Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.</item>
        <item>Those who swear to abstain from their wives have four
months of waiting. ¹²¹ Therefore, if they revert back, Allah is MostForgiving, Very-Merciful,</item>
        <item>And if they resolve to divorce, Allah is All-Hearing,
All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Divorced women shall keep themselves waiting for three
periods, and it is not permissible for them to conceal what Allah has
created in their wombs, ¹²² if they believe in Allah and in the Last
Day. Their husbands are best entitled to take them back in the
meantime, if they want a settlement. Women have rights similar to what
they owe in recognized manner though for men there is a step above
them. Allah is Mighty, Wise.</item>
        <item>Divorce is twice; then either to retain in all fairness,
or to release nicely. ¹²³ It is not lawful for you to take back
anything from what you have given them, ¹²⁴ unless both apprehend that
they would not be able to maintain the limits set by Allah. Now, if
you apprehend that they would not maintain the limits set by Allah,
then, there is no sin on them in what she gives up to secure her
release. These are the limits set by Allah. Therefore, do not exceed
them. Whosoever exceeds the limits set by Allah, then, those are the
transgressors.</item>
        <item>Thereafter, if he divorces her, she shall no longer
remain lawful for him ¹²⁵ unless she marries a man other than him.
Should he too divorce her, then there is no sin on them in their
returning to each other, if they think they would maintain the limits
set by Allah. These are the limits set by Allah that He makes clear to
a people who know (that Allah is alone capable of setting these
limits).</item>
        <item>When you have divorced women, and they have approached
(the end of) their waiting periods, then, either retain them with
fairness or release them with fairness. Do not retain them with
wrongful intent, resulting in cruelty on your part, and whoever does
this, actually wrongs himself. Do not take the verses of Allah in
jest, and remember the grace of Allah on you and what He has revealed
to you of the Book and the wisdom, giving you good counsel thereby,
and fear Allah, and be sure that Allah is the One who knows
everything.</item>
        <item>When you have divorced women, and they have reached (the
end of) their waiting period, do not prevent them from marrying their
husbands when they mutually agree with fairness. Thus the advice is
given to everyone of you who believes in Allah and in the Hereafter.
This is more pure and clean for you. Allah knows and you do not know.
</item>
        <item>Mothers (should) suckle their children for two full
years, for one who wants to complete the (period of) suckling. It is
the obligation of the one to whom the child belongs that he provides
food and clothing for them (the mothers) with fairness. Nobody is
obligated beyond his capacity. No mother shall be made to suffer on
account of her child, nor the man to whom the child belongs, on
account of his child. ¹²⁶ Likewise responsibility (of suckling) lies on
the (one who may become an) heir (of the child). ¹²⁷ Now, if they want
to wean, with mutual consent and consultation, there is no sin on
them. And If you want to get your children suckled (by a wet-nurse),
there is no sin on you when you pay off what you are to give with
fairness, and fear Allah, and be assured that Allah is watchful of
what you do.</item>
        <item>Those among you who pass away and leave wives behind,
their wives keep themselves waiting for four months and ten days. ¹²⁸
So, when they have reached (the end of) their waiting period, there is
no sin on you in what they do for themselves in recognized manner.
Allah is All-Aware of what you do.</item>
        <item>There is no sin on you if you hint as a proposal to the
women, or conceal it in your hearts. Allah knows that you will make
mention of them. But do not make a promise to them secretly, except
that you speak in a recognized manner. Nor resolve upon a contract of
marriage until the prescribed time is reached. Be assured that Allah
knows what is in your hearts. So, fear Him and be assured that Allah
is most Forgiving, Forbearing.</item>
        <item>There is no liability (of dower) on you if you divorce
women when you have not yet touched them, nor fixed for them an
amount. So, give them mut‘ah (a gift), ¹²⁹ a rich man according to his
means and a poor one according to his means - a benefit in the
recognized manner, an obligation on the virtuous.</item>
        <item>If you divorce them before you have touched them, while
you have already fixed for them an amount (of dower), then there is
one half of what you have fixed, unless they (the women) forgive, or
forgives the one in whose hand lies the marriage tie, ¹³⁰ and it is
closer to Taqwa (righteousness) that you forgive, and do not forget to
be graceful to one another. Surely, Allah is watchful of what you do.
</item>
        <item>Take due care of all the prayers, and the middle prayer,
and stand before Allah in total devotion. ¹³¹</item>
        <item>But if you are in fear, then (pray) on foot or riding.
¹³² but when you are in peace, recite Allah’s name ¹³³ as He has
taught you what you did not know.</item>
        <item>Those among you who pass away and leave wives behind are
(commanded) to make a will in favour of their wives to be maintained
for one year without being expelled (from husband’s home). Then, if
they move out, there is no sin on you in what they have done for
themselves according to the fair practice. Allah is Mighty, Wise.
¹³⁴</item>
        <item>The divorced women deserve a benefit according to the
fair practice, ¹³⁵ being an obligation on the God-fearing.</item>
        <item>This is how Allah makes His verses clear to you, so that
you may understand.</item>
        <item>Have you not seen those who left their homes, while they
were in thousands, to escape death? So, Allah said to them, “Be dead.”
Then He raised them alive. ¹³⁶ Surely, Allah is gracious to people, but
most of the people are not grateful.</item>
        <item>Fight in the way of Allah, and know that Allah is AllHearing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Who is the one who would give Allah a good loan so that
Allah multiplies it for him many times? ¹³⁷ Allah withholds and
extends, and to Him you are to be returned.</item>
        <item>Did you not see a group from the children of Isra’il
(Israel), after (the time of) Musa when they said to their prophet: ¹³⁸
“Appoint for us a king, so that we may fight in the way of Allah.”He
said: “Is it (not) likely, if fighting is enjoined upon you, that you
would not fight.” They said: “What is wrong with us that we would not
fight while we have been driven away from our homes and our sons?”
But, when fighting was enjoined upon them, they turned away, except a
few of them, and Allah is Aware of the unjust.</item>
        <item>Their prophet said to them: “Allah has appointed Talut
as a king for you.” They said: “How could he have kingship over us
when we are more entitled to the kingship than him? He has not been
given affluence in wealth.” He said: “Allah has chosen him over you
and has increased his stature in knowledge and physique, and Allah
gives His kingship to whom He wills. Allah is All-Embracing, AllKnowing.’’</item>
        <item>Their prophet said to them: “The sign of his kingship is
that the Ark¹³⁹ shall come to you, carried by the angels, having
therein tranquillity from your Lord, and the remains of what the House
of Musa and the House of Harun (Aaron) had left. Surely, in it there
is a sign for you, if you are believers.”</item>
        <item>So, when Talut set out along with the troops, he said:
“Allah is going to test you by a river, so, whoever drinks from it is
not my man, and whoever does not taste it is surely a man of mine,
except the one who scoops a little with his hand.” ¹⁴⁰ then they drank
from it, except a few of them. So, when it (the river) was crossed by
him and by those who believed with him, they said: “There is no
strength with us today against Jalut and his troops." Said those who
believed in their having to meet Allah: "How many small groups have
overcome large groups by the will of Allah. Allah is with those who
remain patient."</item>
        <item>And when they faced Jalut and his troops, they said:
“Our Lord, pour out endurance on us, make firm our feet and help us
against the disbelieving people.”</item>
        <item>So, they defeated them by the will of Allah, and Dawud
(David) killed Jalut, ¹⁴¹ and Allah gave him the kingdom and the wisdom
and taught him what He willed. Had Allah not been pushing back some
people by means of others, the earth would have been spoiled. But
Allah is All-Gracious to all the worlds.</item>
        <item>These are the verses of Allah that We recite to you (O
Prophet), with all veracity, and certainly you are among the
Messengers.</item>
        <item>Those are the messengers some of whom We have given
excellence over some others. Among them there are ones to whom Allah
spoke (directly) and He raised some of them steps higher (in other
respects), and We gave clear signs to ‘Isa (Jesus), the son of Maryam
(Mary) and supported him with the Holy Spirit. ¹⁴² If Allah so willed,
those succeeding him would have not fought against each other after
clear signs had come to them.But they disagreed among themselves. So,
there were some who believed and there were some who disbelieved, and
if Allah so willed, they would have not fought against each other. But
Allah does what He intends.¹⁴³</item>
        <item>O you who believe! Spend from what We have given to you
before a day comes when there will be no trading, no friendship and no
intercession, and it is the disbelievers who are unjust.</item>
        <item>Allah: There is no god but He, the Living, the AllSustaining. Neither dozing overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs all
that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth. Who can intercede
with Him without His permission? He knows what is before them and what
is behind them; while they encompass nothing of His knowledge, except
what He wills. His Kursiyy (Chair) extends to the Heavens and to the
Earth, and it does not weary Him to look after them. He is the AllHigh, the Supreme.</item>
        <item>There is no compulsion in Faith. The correct way has
become distinct from the erroneous. Now, whoever rejects the Taghut
(the Rebel, the Satan) and believes in Allah has a firm grasp on the
strongest ring that never breaks. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
</item>
        <item>Allah is the Protector of those who believe. He brings
them out of the depths of darkness into the light. As for those who
disbelieve, their friends are the Rebels. They bring them out from the
light into the depths of darkness. Those are people of the Fire. There
they will remain forever.</item>
        <item>Do you not know the one who argued with Ibrahim ¹⁴⁴ about
his Lord, because Allah had given him kingship? When Ibrahim said: “My
Lord is the One Who gives life and brings death,” he said: “I give
life and I bring death.” ¹⁴⁵ Said Ibrahim: “Allah brings the sun out
from the East; now, you bring it out from the West.” Here, baffled was
the one who disbelieved, and Allah does not bring the wrongdoers to
the right path.</item>
        <item>Or, (do you not know) the example of the one who passed
through a town that had collapsed on its roofs. ¹⁴⁶ He said: “How shall
Allah revive this after it is dead?” So, Allah made him dead for a
hundred years, then raised him saying: “How long did you remain (in
this state)?” He said: “I remained for a day or part of a day”. Said
He: “Rather, you remained (dead) for a hundred years. Just look at
your food and your drink; it has not spoiled. Now look at your donkey.
¹⁴⁷ (We did) this to make you a sign for people! Look at the bones, how
We raise them, then dress them with flesh." So, when it was clear to
him, he said: "I know that Allah is Powerful over everything."</item>
        <item>Remember) when Ibrahim said: “My Lord, show me how You
give life to the dead.” He said: “Is it that you do not believe?’’ He
said: “Of course, I do, but it is just to make my heart at peace.’’ He
said: “Then take four birds and tame them to your call, then put on
every mountain a part from them, then give them a call, and they shall
come to you rushing, and know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.’’</item>
        <item>The example of those who spend in the way of Allah is
just like a grain that produced seven ears, each ear having a hundred
grains, and Allah multiplies (the reward) for whom He wills. Allah is
All-Embracing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, then
do not make their spending followed by boasting about favour, or with
causing hurt,__ they have their reward with their Lord and there is no
fear for them nor shall they grieve.</item>
        <item>A graceful word and forgiving is better than charity
followed by causing hurt. Allah is All-Independent, Forbearing.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not nullify your acts of charity
by boasting about (doing people a) favour and by causing (them) hurt,
like the one who spends his wealth to show off before people and does
not believe in Allah and in the Last Day. So, his example is like a
rock on which there is dust, then a heavy rain came over it and left
it barren. ¹⁴⁸ they have no ability to gain anything out of what they
have done, and Allah does not give guidance to the people who
disbelieve.</item>
        <item>The example of those who spend their wealth to seek the
pleasure of Allah and to make firm (their faith) from (the depths of)
their souls is like a garden on a foothill on which came a heavy rain,
and it yielded its produce twofold. Even if a heavy rain does not come
to it, a light drizzle is enough, and Allah is watchful of what you
do.</item>
        <item>Would any of you wish to have a garden of dates and
grapes, with rivers flowing beneath it, in which there are all kinds
of fruit for him, and old age befalls him, and he has children who are
(too) weak (to earn livelihood), then a whirlwind comes upon it with
fire in it, and it is all burnt? ¹⁴⁹ This is how Allah makes the signs
clear to you, so that you may ponder.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, spend of the good things you have
earned, and of what We have brought forth for you from the earth, and
do not opt for a bad thing, spending only from it, while you are not
going to accept it (if such a thing is offered to you), unless you
close your eyes to it, and know well that Allah is All-Independent,
Ever-Praised.</item>
        <item>Satan frightens you with poverty, and bids you to commit
indecency, and Allah promises you forgiveness from Him, and grace as
well. And Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>He gives wisdom to whom He wills, and whoever is given
wisdom is certainly given a lot of good. Only the people of
understanding observe the advice.</item>
        <item>Whatever expenditure you spend and whatever vow you
make, Allah knows all of it, and for the unjust, there are no
supporters.</item>
        <item>If you make sadaqat (alms) openly, it is good enough,
and if you keep it secret and give it to the needy, it is much better
for you, and this will write off part of your sins. Allah is All-Aware
of what you do.</item>
        <item>It is not for you to put them on the right path. ¹⁵⁰
Rather, Allah puts on the right path whom He wills. Whatever good you
spend is for your own selves, and you shall not spend but to seek the
pleasure of Allah, and whatever good thing you spend shall be repaid
to you in full, and you shall not be wronged.</item>
        <item>Your charities should be preferably meant) for the needy
who are confined in the way of Allah, unable to travel in the land. ¹⁵¹
an ignorant person takes them as free of need because of their
abstinence. You know them by their appearance (from begging). They do
not beg people importunately, and whatever good thing you spend, Allah
is All-Aware of it.</item>
        <item>Those who spend their wealth night and day, secretly and
openly,__ they have their reward with their Lord, and there is no fear
for them, nor shall they grieve.</item>
        <item>Those who take riba (usury or interest) will not stand
but as stands the one whom the demon has driven crazy by his touch.
That is because they have said: “Sale is but like riba.’’, while Allah
has permitted sale, and prohibited riba. So, whoever receives an
advice from his Lord and desists (from indulging in riba), then what
has passed is allowed for him, and his matter is up to Allah. As for
the ones who revert back, those are the people of Fire. There they
will remain forever.</item>
        <item>Allah destroys riba and nourishes charities, and Allah
does not like any sinful disbeliever.</item>
        <item>Surely those who believe and do good deeds, and
establish Salah (prayer) and pay Zakah will have their reward with
their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
</item>
        <item>O you who believe, fear Allah and give up what still
remains of riba, if you are believers.</item>
        <item>But if you do not (give it up), then listen to the
declaration of war from Allah and His Messenger. However, If you
repent, yours is your principal. Neither wrong, nor be wronged.</item>
        <item>If there is one in misery, then (the creditor should
allow) deferment till (his) ease, and that you forgo it as alms is
much better for you, if you really know.</item>
        <item>Be fearful of a day when you shall be returned to Allah,
then every person shall be paid, in full, what he has earned, and they
shall not be wronged.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, when you transact a debt payable at a
specified time, put it in writing, and let a scribe write it between
you with fairness. A scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has
educated him. He, therefore, should write. The one who owes something
should get it written, but he must fear Allah, his Lord, and he should
not omit anything from it. If the one who owes is feeble-minded or
weak or cannot dictate himself, then his guardian should dictate with
fairness. Have two witnesses from among your men, and if two men are
not there, then one man and two women from those witnesses whom you
like, so that if one of the two women errs, the other woman may remind
her. The witnesses should not refuse when summoned. And do not be
weary of writing it down, along with its due date, no matter whether
the debt is small or large. That is more equitable in Allah’s sight,
and more supportive as evidence, and more likely to make you free of
doubt. However, if it is a spot transaction you are effecting between
yourselves, there is no sin on you, should you not write it. Have
witnesses when you transact a sale. Neither a scribe should be made to
suffer, nor a witness. If you do (something harmful to them), it is
certainly a sin on your part, and fear Allah. Allah educates you, and
Allah is All-Knowing in respect of everything.</item>
        <item>If you are on a journey, and find no scribe, then (you
may have resort to holding something as) mortgage, taken into
possession. However, if one of you trusts the other, then the one who
has been trusted should fulfill his trust, and should fear Allah, his
Lord. Do not conceal testimony. Whoever conceals it, his heart is
surely, sinful. Allah is All-Aware of what you do.</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs what is in the heavens and what is in
the earth. If you disclose what is in your hearts or conceal it, Allah
shall hold you accountable for it, then He will forgive whom He wills
and punish whom He wills. Allah is powerful over everything.</item>
        <item>The Messenger has believed in what has been revealed to
him from his Lord, and the believers as well. All have believed in
Allah and His angels and His Books and His Messengers. “We make no
division between any of His Messengers,” and they have said: “We have
listened, and obeyed. Our Lord, (we seek) Your pardon! And to You is
the return.”</item>
        <item>Allah does not obligate anyone beyond his capacity. For
him is what he has earned, and on him what he has incurred. “Our Lord,
do not hold us accountable, if we forget or make a mistake, and, Our
Lord, do not place on us such a burden as You have placed on those
before us, and, Our Lord, do not make us bear a burden for which we
have no strength. And pardon us, and grant us forgiveness, and have
mercy on us. You are our Lord. So then help us against the
disbelieving people.”</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Alif. Lam. Mim . ¹</item>
        <item>Allah: There is no god but He, the Alive, the All-
Sustaining.</item>
        <item>He has revealed to you the Book with the truth,
confirming what has been before it, and has sent down the Torah and
the Injil</item>
        <item>Earlier to give guidance to mankind, and has sent down
the Furqan (the Criterion of right and wrong). Surely, those who have
rejected the verses of Allah, for them there is severe punishment.
Allah is Mighty, the Lord of Retribution.</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah is such that nothing is hidden from Him,
neither in the earth nor in the sky.</item>
        <item>He is the One Who shapes you in the wombs as He likes.
²here is no god but He, the Mighty, the Wise.</item>
        <item>He is the One who has revealed to you the Book (the
Qur’an). Out of it there are verses that are Muhkamat (of established
meaning), which are the principal verses of the Book, and some others
are Mutashabihat (whose definite meanings are unknown). Now those who
have perversity in their hearts go after such part of it as is
mutashabih, seeking (to create) discord, and searching for its
interpretation (that meets their desires), while no one knows its
interpretation except Allah; and those well-grounded in knowledge say:
"We believe therein; all is from our Lord." ³ Only the men of
understanding observe the advice.</item>
        <item>Our Lord, do not let our hearts deviate from the right
path after You have given us guidance, and bestow upon us mercy from
Your own. Surely, You, and You alone, are the One who bestows in
abundance.</item>
        <item>Our Lord, You are going to assemble all the people on a
day in (the occurrence of) which there is no doubt. Verily, Allah does
not back out of His promise.”</item>
        <item>Surely, those who disbelieve, their wealth and their
children shall not suffice them in the least against Allah. Those are
the fuel of the Fire</item>
        <item>A case similar to that of the House of Pharaoh and those
before them. They denied our signs. So, Allah seized them for their
sins. Allah is severe in punishment.</item>
        <item>Say to those who disbelieve: “You shall soon be overcome
and shall be gathered into Hell. Indeed, it is an evil bed (in which)
to rest.”</item>
        <item>There was a sign for you in the two groups who
confronted each other: One group fighting in the way of Allah, and the
other disbelieving, seeing themselves as twice their number, with open
eyes. ⁴ And Allah gives strength with His help to whomsoever He wills.
Indeed, there is a lesson therein for those who have eyes.”</item>
        <item>It has been made attractive for people to love the
desired things; that is, women, children, hoarded heaps of gold and
silver, branded horses, cattle and tillage. That is an enjoyment of
the worldly life; but with Allah lies the beauty of the final resort.
</item>
        <item>Say: “Shall I tell you what is far better than that? For
those who fear (Allah), there are gardens with their Lord, beneath
which rivers flow, where they shall live forever, with purified wives,
and approval from Allah. Allah is watchful over His servants”.</item>
        <item>Those (are the ones) who say: “Our Lord, surely we have
believed, so forgive us our sins and save us from the punishment of
the Fire,”</item>
        <item>And those who are) the patient, the truthful and the
devout, who spend (in Allah’s way) and who seek forgiveness in predawn hours.”</item>
        <item>Allah bears witness that there is no god but He __ and
(so do) the angels and the men of knowledge __ being the One who
maintains equity. There is no god but He, the Mighty, the Wise.</item>
        <item>Truly, the (recognized) religion in the sight of Allah
is Islam . Those who have been given the Book did not differ (among
themselves) until after the knowledge had come to them, (and all this)
due to envy against each other. Whoever denies the verses of Allah,
then, Allah is swift at reckoning.</item>
        <item>Then, if they argue with you, say: “I have submitted
myself to Allah, and (so did) those who have followed me.” And say to
those who have been given the Book, and to the unlettered: ⁵ Do you
submit?” If they submit, they will be on the right path. Yet, if they
turn back, then you have only to convey the message. Allah is watchful
over (all of) His servants.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who reject the verses of Allah and slay
the prophets unjustly, and slay those of the people who bid justice,
give them ‘the good news’ of a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>Those are the ones whose deeds have gone to waste in
this world and in the Hereafter. For them there are no helpers.</item>
        <item>Did you not observe those who have been given a share
from the Book? They are invited to the Book of Allah, so that it may
decide between them. Then, a group from them goes back, turning their
faces away.</item>
        <item>That is because they have said: “The Fire shall not
touch us except for a few days.” Thus they are deceived in their faith
by what they themselves used to invent.</item>
        <item>Then, how (will it be) when We will gather them together
on a day about which there is no doubt, and everybody will be paid in
full for what he has earned, and they shall not be wronged?</item>
        <item>Say: “O Allah, O Lord of the Kingdom, You give kingdom
to whom You will, and take kingdom away from whom You will; and You
bestow honor on whom You will, and bring disgrace to whom You will. In
your hand lies the betterment (of everyone). You are surely powerful
over everything.</item>
        <item>You make the night enter into the day, and make the day
enter into the night; and You bring the living out from the dead, and
bring the dead out from the living, and You give to whom You will
beyond measure.”</item>
        <item>The believers must not take the disbelievers as friends
instead of the believers.⁶ and whoever does that has no relation with
Allah whatsoever, unless you (do so) as a protective measure (in order
to) save yourself from them. ⁷ Allah warns you of Himself, for unto
Allah is the return.</item>
        <item>Say: “Whether you conceal what is in your hearts or
reveal it, Allah will know it.” He knows what is in the heavens and
what is in the earth. Allah is powerful over everything.</item>
        <item>On the day when everybody shall find present before him
whatever good he did and whatever evil he wrought, he will wish there
would have been a wide space between him and that (day). Allah warns
you of Himself, and Allah is compassionate to (His) servants.</item>
        <item>Say (O Prophet): “If you really love Allah, then follow
me, and Allah shall love you and forgive you your sins. Allah is MostForgiving, Very-Merciful.”</item>
        <item>Say: “Obey Allah and the Messenger.” Then, should they
turn back, Allah does not love the disbelievers.”</item>
        <item>Verily, Allah has chosen ’Adam and Nuh (Noah) and the
House of Ibrahim and the House of ‘Imran over all the worlds</item>
        <item>A progeny some of whom resembles the others (in faith).
Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Remember) when ‘Imran’s wife ⁸ said: “O my Lord, I have
vowed that what is in my womb will be devoted exclusively for You. So,
accept (it) from me. You, certainly You, are the All-Hearing, the AllKnowing.”</item>
        <item>So, when she delivered her, she said: “O my Lord, I have
delivered her, a female child.”__And Allah knew better what she had
delivered, and the male was not like the female ⁹___” I have named her
Maryam, and I place her and her progeny under Your shelter against
Satan, the rejected.”</item>
        <item>So, her Lord accepted her, a good acceptance, and made
her grow, a good growth, and made Zakariyya her guardian. Whenever
Zakariyya visited her at the place of worship, he found food with
her.¹⁰ He said: “Maryam, from where did you have this?” She said: “It
is from Allah. Surely, Allah gives whom He wills without
measure.”</item>
        <item>Thereupon, Zakariyya prayed to his Lord. He said: “O my
Lord, grant me from Your own (power) a goodly progeny. ¹¹ Verily, You
are the One who listens to the prayer.”</item>
        <item>So then, when he stood praying in the place of worship,
the angels called out to him saying: “Allah gives you the good news of
Yahya who shall come to confirm a word of Allah ¹² and shall be a
chief, abstinent (from women), a prophet and one of the
righteous.”</item>
        <item>He said: “O my Lord, how shall I have a boy when old age
has come upon me and my wife is barren?” ¹³ Said He: “That is how
Allah does what He wills.”</item>
        <item>He said: “O my Lord, set for me a sign.” Said He: “Your
sign is that you shall not be able to speak to people for three days
except through gestures. ¹⁴ Remember your Lord much; and proclaim His
purity in the evening and the morning.”</item>
        <item>And when the angels said: “O Maryam, Allah has chosen
you and purified you and chosen you over the women of all the worlds.
</item>
        <item>O Maryam, stand in devotion to your Lord and prostrate
yourself and bow down in Ruku‘ with those who bow.”</item>
        <item>This is a part of the news of the unseen We reveal to
you (O Prophet!). You were not with them when they were casting their
pens (to decide) who, from among them, should be the guardian of
Maryam, ¹⁵ nor were you with them when they were quarrelling.</item>
        <item>Remember the time) when the angels said: “O Maryam,
Allah gives you the good news of a Word from Him ¹⁶ whose name is Masih
‘Isa , the son of Maryam (the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary) a man of
status in this world and in the Hereafter, and one of those who are
near (to Allah).</item>
        <item>He shall speak to people while (he is still) in the
cradle, and also later, when he is of mature age; and he shall be one
of the righteous.”</item>
        <item>She said: “O my Lord, how shall I have a son while no
human has ever touched me?” Said He: “That is how Allah creates what
He wills. When He decides a matter, He simply says to it ‘Be’, and it
comes to be.</item>
        <item>He shall teach him the Book and the Wisdom, and the
Torah and the Injil,</item>
        <item>And (shall make him) a messenger to the Children of
Isra’il (who will say to them): “I have come to you with a sign from
your Lord, that is, I create for you from clay something in the shape
of a bird, then I blow in it, and it becomes a living bird by the will
of Allah; and I cure the born-blind and the leper, and I cause the
dead to become alive by the will of Allah; and I inform you of what
you eat and what you store in your homes. In this there is surely a
sign for you, if you are (truly) believers.</item>
        <item>I have come to you) confirming that (book) which is
(sent down) prior to me, that is, the Torah, and to make permissible
for you some of what was prohibited to you. I have come to you with a
sign from your Lord. So, fear Allah and obey me.</item>
        <item>Allah is surely my Lord and your Lord. So, worship Him.
This is the straight path.”</item>
        <item>So, when ‘Isa sensed disbelief in them, he said: “Who
are my helpers in the way of Allah?” The disciples said: “We are
helpers of Allah. We believe in Allah; so be our witness that we are
Muslims.”</item>
        <item>Our Lord, we have believed in what You have revealed,
and we have followed the messenger. So, record us with those who bear
witness (to the Truth).”</item>
        <item>They (the opponents of ‘Isa ) devised a plan, and Allah
devised a plan. ¹⁷ And Allah is the best of all planners.</item>
        <item>When Allah said: “O ‘Isa , I am to take you in full ¹⁸
and to raise you towards Myself, and to cleanse you of those who
disbelieve, and to place those who follow you above those who
disbelieve up to the Day of Doom. Then to Me is your return, whereupon
I shall judge between you in that over which you have differed.</item>
        <item>As for those who disbelieve, I shall punish them a
severe punishment in this world and in the Hereafter; and for them
there are no helpers.”</item>
        <item>As for those who believe and do good deeds, He (Allah)
will give them their rewards in full. Allah does not like
transgressors.</item>
        <item>This We recite to you of the Verses and the Message that
is full of wisdom.</item>
        <item>Surely, the case of ‘Isa , in the sight of Allah, is
like the case of ’Adam .¹⁹ He created him from dust, then He said to
him, “Be”, and he came to be.</item>
        <item>The truth is from your Lord. So, do not be of those who
doubt.</item>
        <item>If someone argues with you (O Prophet) over this after
the knowledge that has come to you, say (to him), “Come, let us call
our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and
yourselves, then (let us) pray and invoke the curse of Allah upon the
liars. ²⁰”</item>
        <item>This is, indeed, the true narration. There exists no god
but Allah. Allah is surely the Almighty, the All-Wise.</item>
        <item>So, should they turn back, Allah is fully aware of the
mischievous people.</item>
        <item>Say, “O people of the Book, come to a word common
between us and between you, that we worship none but Allah, that we
associate nothing with Him and that some of us do not take others as
Lords instead of Allah.” Then, should they turn back, say, “Bear
witness that we are Muslims.”</item>
        <item>O people of the Book, why do you argue about Ibrahim,
while the Torah and the Injil were not revealed until after him? ²¹
Have you, then, no sense?</item>
        <item>Look, this is what you are - you have already argued
about matters concerning which you have knowledge; why then do you
argue about matters of which you have no knowledge? Allah knows and
you do not know.</item>
        <item>Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian. But he was
upright, a Muslim, and was not one of those who associate partners
with Allah.</item>
        <item>The closest of people to Ibrahim are those who followed
him, and this prophet, and those who believe; and Allah is the
Guardian of all believers.</item>
        <item>A group from the people of the Book loves to mislead
you, while they mislead none but themselves, and they do not realize.
</item>
        <item>O people of the Book, why do you disbelieve in the
verses of Allah (revealed in the former Scriptures to foretell about
the advent of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W)) while you are yourselves
witnesses (to those verses)?</item>
        <item>O People of the Book, why do you confound the truth with
falsehood, and conceal the truth when you know (the reality)?</item>
        <item>And a group from the people of the Book said (to their
people), “Believe in what has been revealed to the believers in the
early part of the day, and disbelieve at the end of it, so that they
may turn back. ²²</item>
        <item>But do not believe (for real) except in those who follow
your faith.” Say, “(Real) guidance is the guidance of Allah.” (But
all that you do is due to your envy) that someone is given what is
similar to that which you have been given, or that they argue against
you before your Lord.” Say, “The bounty is in the hands of Allah. ²³
He gives it to whom He wills. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
</item>
        <item>He chooses for His grace whom He wills. Allah is the
Lord of great bounty.”</item>
        <item>Among the people of the Book there is one who, if you
entrust him with a heap (of gold or silver), will give it back to you;
and among them there is one who, if you entrust him with a single
dinar (a coin of gold), he will not give it back to you, unless you
keep standing over him. This is because they have said, “There is no
way we can be blamed in the matter of the unlettered.” ²⁴ And they
tell lies about Allah knowingly.</item>
        <item>Why (will they) not (be blamed)? Whoever fulfils his
pledge and fears Allah, then, Allah loves the God-fearing.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who take a small price by (breaking) the
covenant of Allah and their oaths, for them there is no share in the
Hereafter, and Allah will neither speak to them, nor will He look
towards them on the Day of Judgment, nor will He purify them. For them
there is a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>Among them there is indeed a group who twist their
tongues while (reading) the Book, so that you may deem it to be from
the Book, while it is not from the Book. They say, “It is from Allah”,
while it is not from Allah; and they tell lies about Allah knowingly.
</item>
        <item>It is not (possible) for a man that Allah gives him the
Book, the wisdom and the prophethood, then he starts saying to the
people “Become my worshippers, aside from Allah” rather, (he would
say), “Be men of the Lord; as you have been teaching the Book, and as
you have been learning it.”</item>
        <item>Nor is it (possible for him) that he bids you to hold
the angels and the prophets as Lords. Shall he bid you to disbelieve,
after your having become Muslims?</item>
        <item>When Allah made the prophets enter into a covenant:
(saying) “If I give you a book and wisdom, then comes to you a
messenger verifying what is with you, you shall have to believe in
him, and you shall have to support him.” He said, “Do you affirm and
accept my covenant in this respect?” They said, “We affirm.” He said,
“Then, bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.”</item>
        <item>Then those who turn back after this, they are the
sinful.</item>
        <item>Are they, then, seeking a religion other than that of
Allah, while to Him alone submit all those in the heavens and the
earth, willingly or unwilling, and to Him they shall be returned?
</item>
        <item>Say, “We believe in Allah and in what has been revealed
to us and in what was revealed to Ibrahim, Isma‘il, Ishaq , Ya‘qub and
the descendants, and in what has been given to Musa, ‘Isa and the
prophets, from their Lord: We do not differentiate between any of
them; and to Him we submit ourselves.”</item>
        <item>Whoever seeks a faith other than Islam, it will never be
accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.
</item>
        <item>How shall Allah give guidance to a people who
disbelieved after they had accepted Faith and testified that the
Prophet is true and the clear signs had come to them? Allah does not
give guidance to the unjust people.</item>
        <item>The punishment of such people is that upon them is the
curse of Allah, of the angels and of the human beings altogether.
</item>
        <item>They will remain under it forever. Neither will the
punishment be lightened for them, nor will they be given respite,
</item>
        <item>Except those who repent afterwards and mend their ways.
Then, Allah is All-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieve after having accepted Faith and
then increase in disbelief, their repentance shall never be accepted.
²⁵ They are the ones who have lost the right path.</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieve and die as disbelievers, even an
Earth-full of gold shall never be accepted from any of them, even if
one were to offer it as ransom. They are the ones for whom there is a
painful punishment, and for them there are no helpers.</item>
        <item>You shall never attain righteousness unless you spend
from what you love. Whatsoever you spend, Allah is fully aware of it.
²⁶</item>
        <item>Every (kind of) food was lawful for the children of
Isra’il, except what Isra’il had made unlawful for himself, well
before the Torah was revealed. Say, “Then, bring the Torah and recite
it, if you are true.”</item>
        <item>²⁷ Then those who forge the lie against Allah, after all
this,__ they are the transgressors.</item>
        <item>Say, “Allah has told the truth. So, follow the Faith of
Ibrahim, the upright one. He was not one of those who ascribe partners
to Allah.”</item>
        <item>The first house set up for the people is surely the one
in Makkah ²⁸ having blessings and guidance for all the worlds.</item>
        <item>In it there are clear signs: The Station of Ibrahim! ²⁹
Whoever enters it is secure. As a right of Allah, it is obligatory on
the people to perform Hajj of the House - on everyone who has the
ability to manage (his) way to it. If one disbelieves, then Allah is
independant of all the worlds.</item>
        <item>Say, “O people of the Book, why do you reject the verses
of Allah while Allah is witness to what you do?”</item>
        <item>³⁰ Say, “O people of the Book, why do you hinder the
believers from the way of Allah, trying to create crookedness in it,
while you yourselves are witnesses (to its being the right way)? Allah
is not oblivious of what you do.”</item>
        <item>O you who believe, if you obey a group from those who
have been given the Book (i.e. the Christians and the Jews), they will
turn you into infidels after you have embraced the faith.</item>
        <item>How could you disbelieve while you are the ones to whom
the verses of Allah are recited, and present amidst you is His
Messenger? Whoever holds on to Allah, is surely led to the straight
path.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, fear Allah, as He should be feared,
and let not yourself die save as Muslims.</item>
        <item>Hold fast, all of you, to the cord of Allah, and be not
divided. Remember the blessing of Allah upon you: When you were
enemies to each other, and He brought your hearts together, so that,
you became brothers through His blessing. You were at the brink of a
pit of Fire, then He saved you from it. This is how Allah makes His
signs clear to you, so that you may take the right path.</item>
        <item>There has to be a group of people from among you who
call towards the good, and bid the Fair and forbid the Unfair. And it
is these who are successful.</item>
        <item>Do not be like those who became divided and fell into
disputes after the clear signs had come to them. Those are the ones
for whom there is a grave punishment</item>
        <item>On a day when some faces shall turn bright, and some
faces shall turn dark. As for those whose faces turn dark, (they shall
be questioned): “Did you disbelieve after you had accepted the Faith?
Now taste the punishment, because you used to disbelieve.”</item>
        <item>As for those whose faces turn bright, they will rest in
Allah’s mercy. They will live there forever.</item>
        <item>These are the verses of Allah We recite to you with all
veracity. Allah does not intend to do injustice to (anyone in) the
worlds.</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs what is in the heavens and what is in
the earth. To Allah all matters are returned.</item>
        <item>You are the best ‘Ummah ever raised for mankind. You bid
the Fair and forbid the Unfair, and you believe in Allah. If the
people of the Book had believed, it would have been better for them.
Among them, there are believers, while most of them are sinners.
</item>
        <item>They shall never (be able to) cause you any harm except
a little hurt. If they fight you, they will turn their backs on you,
then they shall not be helped.</item>
        <item>Disgrace has been stamped over them wherever they are
found, unless (saved) through a source from Allah and through a source
from men, ³¹ and they have returned with wrath from Allah, and misery
has been stamped over them. All this is because they used to deny the
signs of Allah, and to slay the prophets unjustly. All this is because
they disobeyed and transgressed the limits.</item>
        <item>Not all of them are alike: Among the people of the Book
there are those who are steadfast; ³² they recite the verses of Allah
in the night hours, and they prostrate themselves;</item>
        <item>They believe in Allah and the Hereafter, and bid the
Fair and forbid the Unfair, and hasten towards good deeds. They are
among the righteous.</item>
        <item>Whatever good they do, they shall never go unappreciated
for it. Allah is All-Aware of the God-fearing.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor
their children shall help them against Allah; and they are the people
of the Fire. They shall be there forever.</item>
        <item>The example of what they spend in this worldly life is
just like a wind that, having chill within, struck the tillage of
those who wronged themselves, and destroyed it. Allah has not wronged
them; rather, they did wrong to themselves.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not take anyone as an insider but
those from among your own selves. They would spare no effort to do you
mischief. They want you to be in trouble. Malice has come out of their
mouths while what is concealed in their hearts is still worse. We have
made the signs clear to you, if only you understand.</item>
        <item>Look, you are the ones who love them and they do not
love you. You believe in all the books; (On the other hand,) when they
meet you, they say, “We believe”, and when they are alone, they bite
their finger-tips out of rage against you. Say, “May you perish in
your rage.” Surely, Allah is All-Aware of what lies in the hearts.
</item>
        <item>If something good happens to you, it annoys them, and if
something evil befalls you, they are delighted with it. If you keep
patience and fear Allah, their cunning shall not harm you at all.
Allah is All-Encompassing of what they do.</item>
        <item>Recall the time when you left your house ³³ in the
morning in order to place the believers in positions for fighting.
Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>When two of your groups were about to lose heart, while
Allah was their guardian! ³⁴ It is in Allah alone that the believers
must place their trust.</item>
        <item>Allah certainly supported you at Badr when you were
weak. So, fear Allah that you may be grateful.</item>
        <item>When you were saying to the believers, “Shall it not
suffice you that your Lord should help you with three thousand of the
angels sent down (for you)?”</item>
        <item>Of course, if you stay patient and fear Allah, and they
come upon you even in this heat of theirs, your Lord will reinforce
you with five thousand of the angels, each having distinct marks.
</item>
        <item>And Allah did this solely to make it a good news for
you, and so that your hearts may be at rest with it. Otherwise,
victory is from none but Allah, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.</item>
        <item>Allah helped you) so that He may cut off a flank of
disbelievers or throw them down in disgrace, and they go back
frustrated.</item>
        <item>You have no authority in the matter, unless Allah
forgives them or punishes them, as they are unjust. ³⁵</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs what is in the heavens and what is in
the earth. He forgives whomsoever He wills and punishes whomsoever He
wills. Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not eat up the amounts acquired
through Riba (interest), doubled and multiplied. ³⁶ Fear Allah, so that
you may be successful,</item>
        <item>And fear the Fire that has been prepared for the
disbelievers.</item>
        <item>Obey Allah and the Messenger, so that you may be
blessed.</item>
        <item>Race with one another towards Forgiveness from your Lord
and towards a paradise the width of which spans the heavens and the
earth. It has been prepared for the God-fearing,</item>
        <item>The ones who spend (for Allah’s sake) in prosperity and
adversity, and those who control anger and forgive people. And Allah
loves those who are good in their deeds,</item>
        <item>And those who, when they happen to commit a shameful act
or wrong themselves, remember Allah, then, seek forgiveness for their
sins__and who is there to forgive sins except Allah?___and do not
persist in what they have done, knowingly.</item>
        <item>Their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens
beneath which rivers flow where they shall live forever. And excellent
is the reward of those who work.</item>
        <item>Many patterns of behavior have passed before you. So,
traverse the land and see what was the fate of those who rejected (the
prophets).</item>
        <item>This is a declaration for mankind, and guidance, and a
lesson for the God-fearing.</item>
        <item>Do not lose heart and do not grieve, and you are the
upper-most if you are believers.</item>
        <item>If you have received a wound, they have received a
similar wound. ³⁷ Such days We rotate among the people, so that Allah
may know those who believe and let some of you be martyrs - and Allah
does not like the unjust</item>
        <item>And so that Allah may purify those who believe and
eradicate the disbelievers.</item>
        <item>Do you think that you shall enter Paradise even before
Allah knows those of you who carry out Jihad and ³⁸ those who are
steadfast.</item>
        <item>You had longed for death ³⁹ before you faced it. Now, you
have seen it with your eyes wide open.</item>
        <item>Muhammad is but a messenger, there have been messengers
before him. So, if he dies or is killed, would you turn back on your
heels? Whoever turns back on his heels can never harm Allah in the
least. Allah shall soon reward the grateful.</item>
        <item>It is not the choice of a person to die without the will
of Allah, death being a time-bound destiny. Whoever seeks a reward in
this world, We shall give him out of it, and whoever seeks a reward in
the Hereafter, We shall give him out of it. We shall soon reward the
grateful.</item>
        <item>There have been many prophets with whom many men of
Allah have fought; they did not lose heart for what they suffered in
the way of Allah, nor did they become weak, nor did they yield. Allah
loves the steadfast.</item>
        <item>They had nothing else to say except that they said: “Our
Lord, forgive us our sins and our excesses in our conduct, make firm
our feet and help us against the disbelieving people.”</item>
        <item>So, Allah gave them the return in this world and also
the better rewards in the Hereafter. Allah loves those who do good.
</item>
        <item>O you who believe, if you obey those who disbelieve,
they will make you turn back on your heels, then you shall turn into
losers.</item>
        <item>Instead, Allah is your Lord, and He is the best of all
helpers.</item>
        <item>We shall put awe into the hearts of those who
disbelieve, since they have associated with Allah something for which
He has not sent any authority. Their ultimate place is the Fire; and
evil is the abode of the unjust.</item>
        <item>Allah has surely fulfilled His promise to you when you,
with His will, were killing them off, until you showed weakness and
disputed in the matter and disobeyed after He had shown you what you
liked. ⁴⁰ Among you there were some who were seeking the mundane, and
among you there were others who were seeking the Hereafter. After
that, He reversed your position against them, so that He may test you.
Of course, He has forgiven you. Allah is All-Gracious to the
believers.</item>
        <item>When you were going away, not even turning to look at
anyone, and the Messenger was calling you from behind you. He awarded
you sorrow for sorrow, ⁴¹ so that you should not grieve (in future)
over what you lost, or for what you suffered. Allah is All-Aware of
what you do.</item>
        <item>Then, after the grief, He poured tranquility upon you -
a drowsiness overtaking a group of you. ⁴² Another group was worrying
about their own selves, harboring thoughts about Allah that were
untrue - thoughts of ignorance. They were saying, “Is there anything
in our hands?” Say, “The whole thing belongs to Allah.” They conceal
in their hearts what they do not disclose to you. They say, “If we had
any say in the matter, we would not have been killed here.” ⁴³ Say, "If
you were in your homes, those destined to be killed would have come
out all the way to their (final) resting -places." (All this was
done) so that Allah may test your inner qualities and may purify what
is in your hearts. Allah is All-Aware of what lies in the hearts.
</item>
        <item>Surely, those of you who turned back on the day when the
two troops faced each other, Satan had but made them slip for some of
their deeds. Of course, Allah has forgiven them. Certainly, Allah is
Most-Forgiving, Very-Forbearing.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not be like those who disbelieved
and said about their brethren while they travelled on the earth or had
to fight, “Had they been with us, they would have not died, nor would
they have been killed.” The result is that Allah makes it a remorse
resting in their hearts. Allah gives life and brings death; Allah is
watchful of what you do.</item>
        <item>If you are killed in the way of Allah or die, the
forgiveness from Allah and the mercy is far better than what they
accumulate.</item>
        <item>If you die or get killed, it is towards Allah that you
shall be gathered.</item>
        <item>So, (O Prophet) it is through mercy from Allah that you
are gentle to them. Had you been rough and hard-hearted, they would
have dispersed from around you. So, pardon them, and seek Forgiveness
for them. Consult them in the matter and, once you have taken a
decision, place your trust in Allah. Surely, Allah loves those who
place their trust in Him.</item>
        <item>If Allah helps you, there is none to overcome you. And
if He abandons you, then, who is there to help you after that? In
Allah the believers should place their trust.</item>
        <item>It is not conceivable from a prophet to misappropriate
the spoils. Whoever misappropriates shall bring forth, on Doomsday,
what he misappropriated. Then, everybody shall be paid, in full, for
what he has earned, and they shall not be wronged.</item>
        <item>How then, could one who submits to the pleasure of Allah
be equal to him who returns with displeasure from Allah? His ultimate
place is the Fire; and what an evil end it is!</item>
        <item>They are of various ranks with Allah. Allah is watchful
of what they do.</item>
        <item>Allah has surely conferred favor on the believers when
He raised in their midst a messenger from among themselves who recites
to them His verses and makes them pure and teaches them the Book and
the Wisdom, while earlier, they were in open error.</item>
        <item>How is it that, when you suffered a hardship the twice
of which you had inflicted upon them, you say, “Where did this come
from?” Say, “This is from your own selves. Allah is surely Powerful
over everything.”</item>
        <item>Whatever you suffered on the day when the two troops
faced each other was by the will of Allah, and in order to know the
believers,</item>
        <item>And in order to know those who are hypocrites. It was
said to them, “Come on, fight in the way of Allah, or defend.” They
said, “Had we known it to be a fight we would have certainly followed
you.” That day, they were nearer to disbelief than they were to
Belief. They utter from their mouths what is not in their hearts.
Allah knows well what they conceal.</item>
        <item>Those who said about their brethren, while themselves
sitting, “Had they obeyed us, they would have not been killed.” Say,
“Then avert death from yourselves if you are true.”</item>
        <item>Never take those killed in the way of Allah as dead.
Rather, they are alive with their Lord, well-provided,</item>
        <item>Happy with what Allah has given them of His grace; and
they feel pleased with the good news, about those left behind them who
could not join them, that there shall be no fear for them nor shall
they grieve.</item>
        <item>They feel pleased with blessing from Allah, and grace,
and with the fact that Allah would not let the reward of the believers
be lost.</item>
        <item>Those who responded to the call of Allah and the
Messenger, even after they had received the wound, ⁴⁴ for those of them
who did good deeds and feared Allah there is a great reward</item>
        <item>That is) those to whom people said, “The people have
gathered against you; so, fear them.” It increased them in Faith and
they said, “Allah is fully sufficient for us, and the best One in whom
to trust.”</item>
        <item>So, they returned with bounty from Allah, and grace,
with no evil having even touched them, and submitted to the pleasure
of Allah. Allah is the Lord of great bounty.</item>
        <item>It is none but Satan who frightens (you) of his friends.
So, do not fear them; but fear Me, if you are believers.</item>
        <item>Those who hasten towards disbelief should not make you
grieve. They cannot harm Allah at all. Allah intends not to spare for
them any share in the Hereafter. For them there is a mighty
punishment.</item>
        <item>Certainly, those who bought disbelief in exchange for
Belief cannot harm Allah at all. For them there is a painful
punishment.</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieve should not think that the respite
We give them is good for them. In fact, We give them respite only that
they may increase in sin, and for them there is a humiliating
punishment.</item>
        <item>Allah is not to leave the believers in the state you are
in, unless He separates the impure from the pure. ⁴⁵ Allah is not to
inform you of the Unseen. ⁴⁶ But Allah selects from His messengers whom
He wills. So, believe in Allah and His messengers. If you believe, and
fear Allah, you will deserve a great reward.</item>
        <item>Those who withhold in miserliness what Allah has given
them out of His grace should not take it as good for them. Instead, it
is bad for them. They shall be forced, on the Doomsday, to put on what
they withheld, as iron-collars round their necks. To Allah belongs the
inheritance of the heavens and the earth. Allah is All-Aware of what
you do.</item>
        <item>Allah has surely heard the words of those who said,
“Allah is poor, and we are rich.” ⁴⁷ We shall write down what they
said, and their killing of the prophets unjustly; and We shall say,
“Taste the punishment of the flaming fire.</item>
        <item>This is due to what your hands sent ahead and that Allah
is not cruel to His servants.”</item>
        <item>(There are) those who have said, “Allah has directed us
that we should not believe in a messenger unless he comes to us with
an offering to be eaten up by the fire.” ⁴⁸ Say, “A number of
messengers have come to you, before me, with clear signs and with what
you have said. So, why did you kill them, if you are true?</item>
        <item>Then if they reject you, then messengers have been
rejected before you. They came with clear signs and the Scriptures and
the enlightening Book.</item>
        <item>Every soul has to taste death. It is on the Day of
Judgement that you shall be paid your rewards in full. So, whoever has
been kept away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise has really
succeeded. The worldly life is nothing but an illusionary enjoyment.
</item>
        <item>Of course, you shall be tested in your wealth and
yourselves; and, of course, you shall hear hurting statements from
those who have been given the Book before you, and from those who
associate (others with Allah in His divinity). If you observe patience
and fear Allah, then this (observance) is among the matters of firm
resolution.</item>
        <item>When Allah took a pledge from those who were given the
Book: “You shall make it known to people, and you shall not conceal
it,” they threw it away behind their backs, and acquired a small price
for it. So, evil is what they acquire.</item>
        <item>Do not think of those who are delighted with what they
did, and love to be praised for what they never did - do not think
they are secure from the punishment. For them there is a painful
punishment.</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the
earth. Allah is powerful to do every thing.</item>
        <item>Surely, in the creation of the heavens and the earth,
and in the alternation of night and day, there are signs for the
people of wisdom,</item>
        <item>Who remember Allah standing and sitting, and (lying) on
their sides, and ponder on the creation of the heavens and the earth
(and say) “Our Lord, You have not created all this in vain. We
proclaim Your purity. So, save us from the punishment of Fire.</item>
        <item>Our Lord, whomsoever You admit into the Fire, he is
disgraced by You indeed, and for the unjust there are no supporters.
</item>
        <item>Our Lord, We heard a herald calling towards Faith:
‘Believe in your Lord.’ So we believed.</item>
        <item>Our Lord, forgive us, then, our sins, and write off our
evil deeds, and make us die only when we have joined the righteous.
[¹⁹³] Our Lord, give us what You have promised us through Your
messengers, and do not put us to disgrace on the Day of Judgement.
Surely you do not go back on Your promise.”</item>
        <item>So, their Lord answered their prayer: “I do not allow
the labour of any worker from among you, male or female, to go to
waste. You are similar to one another. ⁴⁹ So, those who emigrated, and
were expelled from their homes, and were tortured in My way, and
fought, and were killed, I shall certainly write off their evil deeds,
and shall certainly admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow,
as a reward from Allah. It is Allah with Whom lies the beauty of the
reward.</item>
        <item>The strutting of the disbelievers about the land should
not deceive you.</item>
        <item>It is just a little enjoyment. After that, their resort
is Hell; and it is an evil abode.</item>
        <item>But those who fear their Lord, for them there are
Gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will live forever - as
hospitality from Allah. What is with Allah is best for the righteous.
</item>
        <item>Surely, among the people of the Book there are those who
believe in Allah, and in what has been sent down to you and what has
been sent down to them, humbling themselves before Allah. They do not
barter away the verses of Allah for paltry (worldly) gains. They have
their reward with their Lord. Surely, Allah is swift at reckoning.
</item>
        <item>O you who believe, be patient, ⁵⁰ compete with each other
in patience, ⁵¹ and guard your frontiers, ⁵² and fear Allah ⁵³, so that
you may be successful.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>O men, fear your Lord ¹who created you from a single
soul, and from it created its match, and spread many men and women
from the two. Fear Allah in whose name you ask each other (for your
rights), and fear (the violation of the rights of) the womb-relations.
²Surely, Allah is watchful over you.</item>
        <item>Give the orphans their property, and do not substitute
what is bad for what is good, and do not eat up their property along
with your own. It is, surely, a great sin.</item>
        <item>If you fear that you will not do justice to the orphans,
then, marry the women you like, ³in twos, in threes and in fours. But,
if you fear that you will not maintain equity, then (keep to) one
woman, ⁴or bondwomen you own. It will be closer to abstaining from
injustice.</item>
        <item>Give women their dower in good cheer. Then, if they
forego some of it, of their own will, you may have it as pleasant and
joyful.</item>
        <item>Do not give the feeble-minded your property ⁵that Allah
has made a means of support for you, and do feed them from it, and
clothe them, and speak to them in fair words.</item>
        <item>Test the orphans until they reach the marriageable age.
Then, if you perceive in them proper understanding, hand their
property over to them, and do not consume it extravagantly and
hastily, lest they should grow up. Whoever is rich should abstain
(from using it for himself), and whoever is poor may have from it (to
the extent of his necessary need) with fairness. So, when you hand
their property over to them, make witnesses upon them. Allah is
sufficient for reckoning.</item>
        <item>For men there is a share in what the parents and the
nearest of kin have left. And for women there is a share in what the
parents and the nearest of kin have left, be it small or large__a
determined share.</item>
        <item>If the relatives (who are not heirs) and the orphans and
the needy are present at the time of distribution, give them some of
it, and speak to them in fair words. ⁶</item>
        <item>Those people should be fearful (in their behavior
towards orphans) who, if they leave behind some helpless children,
would remain anxious for them. So, they should fear Allah and say what
is right.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who unjustly devour the property of the
orphans do nothing but devour fire into their bellies, and soon they
shall enter a blazing Hell.</item>
        <item>Allah directs you concerning your children: ⁷ for a male
there is a share equal to that of two females. But, if they are (only)
women, more than two, then they get two-thirds of what one leaves
behind. If she is one, she gets one-half. As for his parents, for each
of them, there is one-sixth of what he leaves in case he has a child.
But, if he has no child and his parents have inherited him, then his
mother gets one-third. If he has some brothers (or sisters),his mother
gets one-sixth, all after (settling) the will he might have made, or a
debt. ⁸ You do not know who, out of your fathers and your sons, is
closer to you in benefiting (you). All this is determined by Allah.
Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>For you there is one-half of what your wives leave
behind, in case they have no child. But, if they have a child, you get
one-fourth of what they leave, after (settling) the will they might
have made, or a debt. For them (the wives) there is one-fourth of what
you leave behind, in case you have no child. But, if you have a child,
they get one eighth of what you leave, after (settling) the will you
might have made, or a debt. And if a man or a woman is Kalalah (i.e.
has neither parents alive, nor children) and has a brother or a
sister, then each one of them will get one-sixth. However, if they are
more than that, they will be sharers in one-third, after (settling)
the will that might have been made, or a debt, provided that the will
must not be intended to harm anyone. This is a direction from Allah.
Allah is All-Knowing, Forbearing.</item>
        <item>These are the limits set by Allah. Whoever obeys Allah
and His Messenger, He will admit him to gardens beneath which rivers
flow, where he will live forever. That is a great success.</item>
        <item>Whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and
transgresses the limits set by Him, He shall admit him to the Fire,
where he will remain forever. For him there is a humiliating
punishment.</item>
        <item>Those of your women who commit the shameful act, have
four witnesses (against them) from among you. So, if they testify,
then confine those women to their homes until death overcomes them, or
Allah prescribes a way for them. ⁹</item>
        <item>Those two of you who commit it, chastise both of them. ¹⁰
However, if they repent and make amends, then, overlook them. Surely,
Allah is Most-Relenting, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>The relenting taken by Allah upon Himself is for those
who do evil in ignorance, then repent shortly thereafter. So, Allah
relents towards them. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>The relenting is not for those who do the evil deeds,
until when the time of death approaches one of them, he says, “Now I
repent”, nor for those who die while they are still disbelievers. For
them We have prepared a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, it is not lawful for you that you
should forcibly take women as inheritance. ¹¹ Do not hold on to them
so that you may take away some of what you have given them, unless
they commit a clearly shameful act. ¹² Live with them in the
recognized manner. If you dislike them, then it is quite likely that
you dislike something and Allah has placed a lot of good in it.</item>
        <item>If you want to take a wife in place of the one (you
have), and you have given her plenty of wealth, then do not take any
of it back. Would you take it through imputation and open sin?
¹³</item>
        <item>How can you take it when you have had access to each
other and they have taken a firm covenant from you?</item>
        <item>Do not marry those women whom your fathers had married
except what has passed. ¹⁴ It is indeed shameful and detestable, and it
is an evil practice.</item>
        <item>Prohibited for you are your mothers, your daughters,
your sisters, your paternal aunts, your maternal aunts, daughters of
brother, daughters of sister, your mothers who suckled you, your
sisters through suckling, mothers of your wives and your stepdaughters under your care who are born of your women with whom you
have had intercourse,_though if you have not had intercourse with
them, there is no sin on you,_and the wives of your sons from your
loins, and that you combine two sisters (in wedlock), except what has
passed. Surely, Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Also prohibited are) the women already bound in
marriage, except the bondwomen you come to own. It has been written by
Allah for you. All (women), except these, have been permitted for you
to seek (to marry) through your wealth, binding yourself, (in
marriage) and not only for lust. So, to those of them whose company
you have enjoyed, give their dues (dower) as obligated. There is no
sin on you in what you mutually agree upon after the (initial)
agreement. ¹⁵ Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>If one cannot afford to marry the free Muslim women,
then (he may marry) the one you people own of your Muslim girls. Allah
knows best about your faith. You are similar to each other. So, marry
them with the permission of their masters, and give them their dues,
as recognized, they being bound in marriage, not going for lust, nor
having paramours. So, once they have been bound in marriage, then, if
they commit a shameful act, they shall be liable to half of the
punishment prescribed for the free women. That is for those of you who
apprehend to indulge in sin. ¹⁶ But that you be patient is better for
you. Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Allah intends (through this Qur’an) to explain to you
(the rules) and to guide you to the ways of those (prophets who
passed) before you, and to turn graciously towards you. Allah is AllKnowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>Allah intends to turn graciously towards you, while
those who follow desires want you to deviate (from the right path), a
huge deviation.</item>
        <item>Allah intends to make things easy on you. And man has
been created weak.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not devour each other’s property
by false means, unless it is trade conducted with your mutual consent.
Do not kill one another. Indeed, Allah has been Very-Merciful to you.
</item>
        <item>Whoever does that out of aggression and injustice, We
shall cast him into the Fire. This is an easy thing for Allah.</item>
        <item>If you abstain from the major (sins) out of what you
have been forbidden from, We shall write off your minor sins, and
shall admit you to a noble entrance.</item>
        <item>Do not covet something in which Allah has made some of
you superior to others. For men there is a share of what they earned,
and for women, a share of what they earned. ¹⁷ Pray to Allah for His
grace. Surely, Allah is All-Aware of everything.</item>
        <item>For everyone We have made heirs in what the parents and
the nearest of kin have left. As for those with whom you have made a
pledge, give them their shares. ¹⁸ Surely, Allah is Witness over
everything.</item>
        <item>Men are caretakers of women, since Allah has made some
of them excel the others, and because of the wealth they have spent.
So, the righteous women are obedient, (and) guard (the property and
honor of their husbands) in (their) absence with the protection given
by Allah. As for women of whom you fear rebellion, convince them, and
leave them apart in beds, and beat them. ¹⁹ Then, if they obey you, do
not seek a way against them. Surely, Allah is the Highest, the
Greatest.</item>
        <item>If you fear a split between them (the spouses), send one
arbitrator from his people and one from her people. If they desire to
set things right, Allah shall bring about harmony between them.
Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.</item>
        <item>Worship Allah, and do not associate with Him anything,
and be good to parents and to kinsmen and orphans and the needy and
the close neighbor and the distant neighbor and the companion at your
side ²⁰ and the wayfarer and to those (slaves who are) owned by you.
Surely, Allah does not like those who are arrogant, proud,</item>
        <item>Those who are miserly and bid people to be miserly, and
conceal what Allah has given them of His grace - and We have prepared
for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment,</item>
        <item>And (for) those who spend their wealth only to show
people, and do not believe in Allah and the Last Day. Anyone for whom
Satan is companion, evil he is as a companion.</item>
        <item>What harm was there for them if they had believed in
Allah and the Last Day, and spent out of what Allah had given them.
Allah knows all about them.</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah does not wrong (anyone), even to the
measure of a particle. If it is a good deed, He multiplies it, and
gives a great reward out of His Own pleasure.</item>
        <item>Then, how (awful a spectacle) would it be when We shall
bring a witness from every community, and shall bring you over them as
a witness.</item>
        <item>On that Day, those who have disbelieved and disobeyed
the Messenger shall wish that the earth were leveled with them. They
shall not (be able to) conceal anything from Allah.</item>
        <item>O you who believe! Do not go near Salah when you are
intoxicated, until you know what you say, nor in a state of ‘major
impurity’. ²¹ , __save when you are traversing a way_ ²² _until you
take a bath. If you are sick, or in travel, or if one of you has come
after relieving himself, or you have had contact with women, and you
find no water, go for some clean dust and wipe your faces and hands
(with it). ²³ Surely, Allah is Most-Pardoning, Most-Forgi</item>
        <item>Have you not observed those who have been given a share
from the Book? They buy misguidance and wish that you (too) lose the
way.</item>
        <item>But Allah knows your enemies very well. Allah is enough
as a friend, and Allah is enough as a supporter.</item>
        <item>Among the Jews there are some who distort the words
against their contexts, and say, “We hear and disobey,” and “Hear. May
you not be made to hear,” and “Ra‘ina”, ²⁴ twisting their tongues and
maligning the Faith. If they had said, “We hear and obey,” and “Hear,”
and “Look after us,” it would have been better for them, and more
proper, but Allah has cast His curse on them due to their disbelief.
So, they do not believe except a few.</item>
        <item>O you who have been given the Book, believe in what We
have revealed confirming what is with you, before We rub off faces and
turn them shaped like their backs, or lay a curse upon them, as We
cursed the People of the Sabbath. Whatever Allah orders is destined to
occur.</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah does not forgive that a partner is
ascribed to Him, and He forgives anything short of that for whomsoever
He wills. ²⁵ Whoever ascribes a partner to Allah commits a terrible
sin.</item>
        <item>Have you not seen those who claim sanctity for
themselves? In fact, Allah sanctifies whom He wills, and they shall
not be wronged even to the measure of a thread of a date-stone.</item>
        <item>See how they fabricate a lie against Allah, and it is
enough to be an open sin.</item>
        <item>Have you not seen those who have been given a share from
the Book? They believe in Jibt and Taghut ²⁴and say concerning those
who disbelieve, “They are better guided in their way than those who
believe.” ²⁶</item>
        <item>Those are the ones whom Allah has cursed, and the one
whom Allah has cursed, for him you shall find no helper.</item>
        <item>Is it that they have a share in the kingdom? If so, they
would give nothing to the people, ²⁷ not even to the measure of a tiny
pit on the back of a date-stone?</item>
        <item>Or, is it that they are jealous of people over what
Allah has given them of His bounty, while We have given to the House
of Ibrahim the Book and the wisdom, and We have given to them a great
kingdom? ²⁹</item>
        <item>So, there were some among them who believed in it, and
there were others among them who turned away from it. Enough (for the
latter) is Jahannam, a fire ablaze!</item>
        <item>Those who have disbelieved in Our verses, We shall
certainly make them enter a fire. Whenever their skins are burnt out,
We shall give them other skins in their place, so that they may taste
the punishment. Surely, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>As for those who have believed and have done good deeds,
We shall admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they
will live forever. For them there are wives purified. We shall admit
them to an umbrageous shade.</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah commands you to deliver trusts to those
entitled to them, and that, when you judge between people, judge with
justice. Surely, excellent is the exhortation Allah gives you. Surely,
Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and
those in authority among you. Then, if you quarrel about something,
revert it back to Allah and the Messenger, ³⁰ if you believe in Allah
and the Last Day. That is good, and the best at the end.</item>
        <item>Have you not seen those who claim that they have
believed in what was revealed to you and what was revealed before you?
They want to take their disputes to the Taghut, ³¹ while they were
ordered to reject it. Satan wants to mislead them to a remote wrong
way.</item>
        <item>When it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has
revealed and to the Messenger,” you will see the hypocrites turning
away from you in aversion.</item>
        <item>But, how (apologetic) they are when they suffer a
calamity because of the acts of their own hands, and they come to you
swearing by Allah, “We meant nothing but to promote good and bring
about harmony.”</item>
        <item>Those are the ones Allah knows what is in their hearts.
So, ignore them, and give them good counsel, and speak to them about
themselves in appealing words.</item>
        <item>We did not send any Messenger but to be obeyed by the
leave of Allah. Had they, after having wronged themselves, come to you
and sought forgiveness from Allah, and had the Messenger prayed for
their forgiveness, they would certainly have found Allah MostRelenting, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>So, never by your Lord! Never shall they become
believers, unless they make you the judge in the disputes that arise
between them, then find no discomfort in their hearts against what you
have decided, and surrender to it in total submission.</item>
        <item>If We had prescribed for them that they should kill
themselves or that they should migrate from their homeland, they would
have not done it, except a few of them. ³² If they had done what they
were advised to do, it would have been better for them, and more
effective in making (them) firm.</item>
        <item>In that case, We would certainly have given them a great
reward</item>
        <item>And we would certainly have led them to a straight path.
</item>
        <item>Those who obey Allah and the Messenger are with those
whom Allah has blessed, namely, the prophets, the Siddiqin, the
Shuhada’ ³³ and the righteous. And excellent are they as companions.
</item>
        <item>That grace is from Allah; and Allah is sufficient as
being the One who knows.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, be on your guard, and march in
groups, or march all together.</item>
        <item>Among you there is one ³⁴ who shall invariably fall back;
then, if some calamity befalls you, he would say, “Allah has shown His
favor to me, as I was not present with them.”</item>
        <item>And if some bounty comes to you from Allah, he will
certainly say,_as if there was no friendship between you and him_ “Oh,
would that I had been with them; then I would have secured a handsome
gain.”</item>
        <item>So, those who sell the worldly life for the Hereafter
should fight in the way of Allah. Whoever fights in the way of Allah,
then gets killed or prevails, We shall give a great reward to him.
</item>
        <item>What has happened to you that you do not fight in the
way of Allah, and for the oppressed among men, women and children who
say, “Our Lord, take us out from this town whose people are cruel, and
make for us a supporter from Your own, and make for us a helper from
Your own.”</item>
        <item>The believers fight in the way of Allah, and the
disbelievers fight in the way of Taghut. So, fight the friends of
Satan. No doubt, the guile of Satan is feeble.</item>
        <item>Have you not seen those to whom it was said, “Hold your
hands (from fighting) and be steadfast in Salah and pay Zakah.”
However, when fighting is enjoined upon them, then surprisingly, a
group from them starts fearing people, as one would fear Allah, or
fearing even more. They say, “Our Lord, why have you enjoined fighting
upon us? Would you have not spared us for a little more time?” ³⁵ Say,
“The enjoyment of the world is but a little, and the Hereafter is far
better for the one who fears Allah, and you shall not be wronged, even
to the measure of a fiber.</item>
        <item>Wherever you will be, Death will overtake you, even
though you are in fortified castles.” If some good comes to them, ³⁶
they say, “This is from Allah.” But if some evil visits them, they
say, “This is from you.” Say, “All is from Allah.” So, what is wrong
with these people, they do not seem to understand anything?</item>
        <item>Whatever good comes to you, it is from Allah and
whatever evil visits you, it comes from your own selves. ³⁷ We have
sent you to be a Messenger for the people. Allah is enough to be a
witness.</item>
        <item>Whoever obeys the Messenger obeys Allah, and whoever
turns away, then, We did not send you to stand guard over them.</item>
        <item>They say, “Obedience (we observe).” But when they go
away from you, a group of them conspires at night contrary to what
they say. Allah records what they conspire. So ignore them and put
your trust in Allah. Allah is enough to trust in.</item>
        <item>Do they not, then, ponder about the Qur’an? Had it been
from someone other than Allah, they would have found in it a great
deal of discrepancy.</item>
        <item>When news concerning peace or fear comes to them, they
go about spreading it. Had they referred it to the Messenger and to
those having authority among them, the truth of the matter would have
come to the knowledge of those of them who are able to investigate. ³⁸
But for Allah’s grace upon you, and mercy, you would have followed the
Satan, save a few.</item>
        <item>So, fight in the way of Allah. You are not responsible
but for yourself, and persuade the believers (to fight in Allah’s
way). It is likely that Allah will prevent the mischief of those who
disbelieve. Allah is the strongest in power and the mightiest in
punishing.</item>
        <item>Whoever makes a good recommendation, there shall be for
him a share from it (in the Hereafter), and whoever makes a bad
recommendation, there shall be for him a share from it. Allah is
powerful over everything.</item>
        <item>When you are greeted with a salutation, greet with one
better than it, or return the same. Surely, Allah is the One who takes
account of everything.</item>
        <item>Allah: There is no god but He. He shall certainly gather
you towards the Day of Doom. There is no doubt about it. Who is more
truthful in his word than Allah?</item>
        <item>So, what is the matter with you that you have become two
groups about the hypocrites, while Allah has reverted them because of
what they did. ³⁹ Do you want to guide the one whom Allah has let go
astray? The one whom Allah lets go astray, you shall never find a way
for him.</item>
        <item>They wish that you should disbelieve, as they have
disbelieved, and thus you become all alike. So, do not take friends
from among them unless they migrate in the way of Allah. Then, if they
turn away, seize them, and kill them wherever you find them, and do
not take from among them a friend or helper.</item>
        <item>Except those who join a group between whom and you there
is a treaty, ⁴⁰ or who come to you with their hearts feeling discomfort
in fighting either against you or against their own people. If Allah
had so willed, He would have given them power over you, then they
would have fought you ⁴¹- so, if they stay away from you, and do not
fight you and offer you peace, then Allah has not given you any
authority against them.</item>
        <item>You will find others who want to be secure from you, and
secure from their own people. (But) whenever they are called back to
the mischief, they are plunged into it. ⁴² So, if they do not stay away
from you, and do not offer peace to you, and do not restrain their
hands, then seize them, and kill them wherever you find them, and, We
have given you an open authority against them.</item>
        <item>It is not for a believer (Muslim) to kill any believer,
except by mistake. Whoever kills a believer by mistake, then, a
believing slave has to be freed, and the blood money must be paid to
his family, unless they forgo it. ⁴³ If he (the victim) belongs to a
people hostile to you and is a believer, then, a believing slave has
to be freed. ⁴⁴ If he (the victim) belongs to a people between whom and
you there is treaty, then, blood money is to be paid to his family, ⁴⁵
and a believing slave to be freed. Whoever does not find one has to
fast for two consecutive months. This is repentance prescribed from
Allah’s side. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>Whoever kills a believer deliberately, his reward is
Jahannam (Hell) where he shall remain forever, and Allah shall be
angry with him and shall cast curse upon him, and He has prepared for
him a mighty punishment.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, when you go out in the way of Allah,
be careful, and do not say to the one who offers you the Salam
(salutation), “You are not a believer” to seek stuff of the worldly
life. ⁴⁶ So, with Allah there are spoils in abundance. In the same
state you were before; then Allah favored you. So, be careful. Surely,
Allah is All-Aware of what you do.</item>
        <item>Those among the believers who sit back, except the
handicapped, are not equal to those who fight in the way of Allah with
their riches and their lives. Allah has raised the rank of those who
fight with their riches and their lives, over those who sit; and to
each, Allah has promised good. ⁴⁷ Allah has given precedence to those
who fight over those who sit in giving them a great reward</item>
        <item>High ranks from Him and forgiveness and mercy. Allah is
Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Those whose souls the angels take while they had wronged
themselves, the angels say (to them), “In what business were you
(involved)?” They say, “We were oppressed in the earth.” They say,
“Was not the earth of Allah wide enough for you to emigrate to it?”
Those people are such that their refuge is Jahannam . It is an evil
place to return;</item>
        <item>Except the oppressed men and women and children, who
cannot have means (to emigrate), nor can find a way.</item>
        <item>As for such, it is likely that Allah would pardon them.
Allah is Most-Pardoning, Most-Forgiving.</item>
        <item>⁴⁸ Whoever migrates in the way of Allah shall find on the
earth many a place to settle, and a wide dimension (of resources).
Whoever leaves his home migrating for the sake of Allah and His
Messenger, and death overtakes him, then, his reward is established
with Allah. Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>When you travel on the earth, there is no sin on you in
shortening your Salah, ⁴⁹ if you fear that the disbelievers would put
you in trouble. Surely, the disbelievers are an open enemy for you.
</item>
        <item>When you (O prophet) are in their midst, and arrange for
them the Salah, then, a party from them should stand with you, and
should take their arms along. Then, once they performed Sajdah, they
should move away from you, and the other party, that has not yet
performed Salah, should come and perform Salah with you, and should
take their precautionary measures and their arms. Those who disbelieve
would want you to become heedless to your arms and your belongings, so
that they come down upon you in a single move. There is no sin on you,
if you have some inconvenience due to rain, or you are sick, in
putting your arms aside, but take your precautionary measures. Surely,
Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.
</item>
        <item>Once you have finished your Salah, then, remember Allah
while standing, sitting and reclining. As soon as you are secure,
perform Salah as due. Surely, Salah is an obligation on the believers
that is tied up with time.</item>
        <item>Do not show weakness in pursuing these people. If you
are suffering, they are suffering as you are suffering, while you hope
from Allah what they do not hope. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
</item>
        <item>Surely, We have revealed to you the Book with the truth,
so that you may judge between people according to what Allah has shown
you. Do not be an advocate for those who breach trust. ⁵⁰</item>
        <item>Seek forgiveness from Allah. Surely, Allah is AllForgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Do not argue on behalf of those who betray themselves.
Surely, Allah does not like anyone who is a sinful betrayer.</item>
        <item>They feel shy before people, but do not feel shy before
Allah. He (Allah) is with them when they make plans at night to give a
statement He (Allah) does not like. Allah encompasses whatever they
do.</item>
        <item>Look, this is what you are! You have argued for them in
the worldly life, but who shall argue for them with Allah on the Day
of Judgement, or who shall be their defender?</item>
        <item>Whoever acts evil or wrongs himself, then seeks
forgiveness from Allah, shall find Allah Most-Forgiving, VeryMerciful.</item>
        <item>Whoever commits a sin, commits it only against himself.
Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>Whoever commits a vice or a sin, then shifts its blame
to an innocent person, he indeed takes the burden of a false
imputation and a glaring sin.</item>
        <item>If the grace of Allah and His mercy had not been with
you, a group from them had resolved to mislead you, while they mislead
none but themselves; and they can do you no harm. Allah has revealed
to you the Book and the wisdom, and has taught you what you did not
know. The grace of Allah on you has always been great.</item>
        <item>There is no good in most of their whisperings, unless
one bids charity or a fair action, or reconciliation between people.
The one who does this, to seek Allah’s pleasure, We shall give him a
great reward.</item>
        <item>Whoever breaks away with the Messenger after the right
path has become clear to him, and follows what is not the way of the
believers, We shall let him have what he chose, and We shall admit him
to Jahannam, which is an evil place to return.</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah does not forgive that a partner is
ascribed to Him, and forgives anything short of that for whomsoever He
wills. ⁵¹ Whoever ascribes a partner to Allah has indeed gone far
astray.</item>
        <item>They invoke none, besides Him, but feminine objects; ⁵²
and they invoke none but Satan, the rebel</item>
        <item>Whom Allah has cursed. He (the Satan) said, “Surely I
will take an appointed share ⁵³ from Your slaves,</item>
        <item>And I will lead them astray, and I will tempt them with
false hopes, and I will command them, whereby they shall slit the ears
of cattle, and I will command them, whereby they shall alter the
creation of Allah.” ⁵⁴ Whoever takes the Satan for friend, instead of
Allah, incurs an obvious loss.</item>
        <item>He (the Satan) makes promises to them, and he tempts
them with hopes. The Satan does not make a promise to them but to
deceive.</item>
        <item>As for such people, their refuge is Jahannam, and they
shall find no escape from it.</item>
        <item>Those who believe and do good deeds, We shall admit them
to the gardens beneath which rivers flow. They shall live there
forever, it being a real promise from Allah; and who is more truthful
than Allah in his word?</item>
        <item>This is not (a matter of) your fancies or the fancies of
the People of the Book. ⁵⁵ Whoever does evil shall be requited for it,
and he shall find neither a friend for himself, besides Allah, nor a
helper.</item>
        <item>Whoever, male or female, does good deeds and is a
believer, then such people shall enter Paradise, and they shall not be
wronged in the least.</item>
        <item>Who is better in Faith than one who has surrendered his
self to Allah and is good in deeds, and has followed the creed of
Ibrahim, the upright. Allah has made Ibrahim a friend.</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs what is in the heavens and what is in
the earth. Allah encompasses every thing.</item>
        <item>They ask you about women. Say, “Allah answers you about
them, and so does what is recited to you from the Book regarding
orphaned women whom you do not give what is prescribed for them and
tend to marry them, ⁵⁶ and regarding the weak from the children, and
that you should maintain justice for the orphans. Whatever good you do
Allah is aware of it.</item>
        <item>If a woman fears ill treatment or aversion from her
husband, then, there is no sin on them in entering into a compromise
between them. Compromise is better. Avarice is made to be present in
human souls. If you do good and fear Allah, then, Allah is All-Aware
of what you do.</item>
        <item>You shall never be able to maintain real equality
between wives, ⁵⁷ even though you are eager to. So, do not lean totally
(towards one) and leave the other as suspended. If you act righteously
and fear Allah, then, Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>If they separate, Allah shall, through His capacity,
make each of them need-free (of the other). Allah is All-Embracing,
All-Wise.</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs what is in the heavens and what is in
the earth. We have ordered those who were given the Book before you,
and (ordered) you yourselves to fear Allah. If you disbelieve, then,
surely to Allah belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the
earth. Allah is All-Independent, Ever-Praised.</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs what is in the heavens and what is in
the earth, ⁵⁸ and Allah is enough to trust in.</item>
        <item>If He so wills, He can remove you, O men, and bring
others (in your place). Allah has the power to do that.</item>
        <item>Whoever seeks the reward of this world, then, with Allah
is the reward of this world and of the Hereafter. Allah is AllHearing, All-Seeing.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, be upholders of justice - witnesses
for Allah, even though against (the interest of) your selves or the
parents, and the kinsmen. One may be rich or poor, Allah is better
caretaker of both. ⁵⁹ So do not follow desires, lest you should swerve.
If you twist or avoid (the evidence), then, Allah is all-aware of what
you do.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do believe in Allah and His Messenger
and in the Book He has revealed to His Messenger and in the Books He
has revealed earlier. Whoever disbelieves in Allah and His angels and
His Books and His Messengers and the Last Day has indeed gone far
astray.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who believed and then disbelieved,
believed again and then disbelieved, then went on increasing in their
disbelief - Allah is not to forgive them nor lead them on the path.
</item>
        <item>Give the hypocrites the ‘good news’ that for them there
is a painful punishment</item>
        <item>Those who take the disbelievers for friends rather than
the believers. Are they seeking honor in their company? But, indeed,
all honor belongs to Allah,</item>
        <item>And He has revealed to you in the Book that when you
hear the verses of Allah being disbelieved and ridiculed, you should
not sit with them unless they enter into some other discourse. You, in
that case, would be like them. Surely, Allah is to gather all
hypocrites and disbelievers in Jahannam .</item>
        <item>Those who look for (a misfortune for) you, so, if there
is a victory for you, they say, “Were we not with you?” But if there
is a gain for the disbelievers, they say (to them), “Had we not
overpowered you, still protected you from the believers?” So, Allah
will decide between you on the Doomsday. Allah shall never give the
disbelievers a way against the believers.</item>
        <item>Surely, the hypocrites (try to) deceive Allah while He
is the One who leaves them in deception. And when they stand for
Salah, they stand up lazily, only to show people, and do not remember
Allah but a little,</item>
        <item>Wavering between (this and) that, neither here nor
there. Whomsoever Allah lets go astray, you shall never find a way for
him.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not take the disbelievers for
friends instead of the believers. Do you want to produce before Allah
a clear evidence against yourselves?</item>
        <item>Surely, the hypocrites are in the lowest level of the
Fire, and you shall never find for them a helper</item>
        <item>Except those who repent and correct themselves and hold
on to Allah and make their Faith pure for Allah. So, those are with
the believers, and Allah will give the believers a great reward.
</item>
        <item>What would Allah get by punishing you, if you are
grateful and believe? Allah is Appreciating, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Allah does not like the evil words to be said openly
except from anyone wronged. ⁶⁰ Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
</item>
        <item>If you do a good act openly or do it in secret, or
forgive an evil deed, then, Allah is All-Forgiving, All-Powerful.
</item>
        <item>Surely those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers,
and wish to make division between Allah and His Messengers, and say,
“We believe in some (messengers) and disbelieve in some others” and
wish to take a way in between that,__</item>
        <item>Those are the disbelievers in reality, and We have
prepared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers.</item>
        <item>Those who have believed in Allah and His Messengers, and
have made no division between any of them, to them He will give their
rewards. Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>The People of the Book ask you to bring down upon them a
Book from the heavens, (which is not strange,) as they had asked Musa
something greater than that when they said, “Make us see Allah
openly.” So, the thunderbolt took them for the wrong they did. Later,
they took to themselves the calf, even after the clear signs had come
to them. Then, We forgave them, and gave Musa an open authority.
</item>
        <item>We raised the (Mount of) Tur high over them for binding
them to the pledge, and We said to them, “Do not transgress in (the
matter of) the Sabbath.” We took from them a firm pledge.</item>
        <item>⁶¹ So, (they met their fate) for breaking their pledge,
and for their disbelief in the verses of Allah, and for their slaying
of the prophets unjustly, and for their saying, “Our hearts are
sealed” - rather, Allah has set a seal over them for their disbelief,
so they do not believe but a little</item>
        <item>And for their disbelief and for what they said against
Maryam as a grim imputation,</item>
        <item>And for their saying, “We have certainly killed the
Masih ‘Isa the son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah”, while in fact
they did neither kill him, nor crucify him, but they were deluded by
resemblance. ⁶² Those who disputed in this matter are certainly in
doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it, but they follow whims.
It is absolutely certain that they did not kill him,</item>
        <item>But Allah lifted him towards Himself. Allah is AllMighty, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>No one will remain from among the People of the Book but
will certainly believe in him before he dies, ⁶³ and on the Day of
Doom, he shall be a witness against them.</item>
        <item>So, because of the transgression of those who became
Jews, We prohibited for them good things which were made lawful for
them earlier ⁶⁴ and for their preventing (people), very often, from the
way of Allah,</item>
        <item>And for their charging Riba (usury or interest) while
they were forbidden from it, and for their devouring of the properties
of the people by false means. We have prepared, for the disbelievers
among them, a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>But those well-grounded in knowledge among them, and the
believers, believe in what has been revealed to you and what has been
revealed before you, __as well as those observing Salah and paying
Zakah, and those believing in Allah and the Last Day. To them we shall
give a great reward.</item>
        <item>Surely, We have revealed to you as We have revealed to
Nuh and to the prophets after him; and We have revealed to Ibrahim,
Isma‘il, Ishaq, Ya‘qub and their children, and to ‘Isa, Ayyub, Yunus,
Harun and Sulaiman, and We have given Zabur to Dawud .</item>
        <item>⁶⁵ (We have sent) some Messengers We have already told
you about, and some other Messengers We did not tell you about, and
Allah has spoken to Musa verbally</item>
        <item>Messengers giving good tidings and warning, so that
people may have no plea against Allah after the Messengers (have
come). Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>But Allah bears witness that what He has revealed to
you, has revealed it with His knowledge. The angels too, bear witness,
(though) Allah is sufficient as witness.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who disbelieved and prevented (people)
from the way of Allah have gone far astray.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who disbelieved and transgressed, Allah is
not going to forgive them, nor to lead them to a way</item>
        <item>Other than the way of Jahannam where they are to remain
for ever. That is easy for Allah.</item>
        <item>O people, the Messenger has come to you with the truth
from your Lord. So, believe. That is good for you. If you disbelieve,
then, to Allah belongs what is in the heavens and the earth. Allah is
All-Knowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>O people of the Book, be not excessive in your Faith, ⁶⁶
and do not say about Allah anything but the truth. The Masih ‘Isa, the
son of Maryam, is only a Messenger of Allah, and His Word that He had
delivered to Maryam, and a spirit from Him. ⁶⁷ So, believe in Allah and
His Messengers. Do not say “Three”. Stop it. That is good for you.
Allah is the only One God. He is far too pure to have a son. To Him
belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. And A</item>
        <item>The Masih shall never spurn to be a slave of Allah, nor
shall the angels who are stationed near to Him. And whoever spurns to
worship Him, and shows arrogance,__then, He shall gather all of them
before Himself.</item>
        <item>As for those who believe and do good deeds, He shall
give them their reward in full, and give them more out of His grace.
But, to those who spurn and show arrogance, He shall give a painful
punishment, and they shall find for themselves neither a friend other
than Allah, nor a helper.</item>
        <item>O people, a proof has come to you from your Lord, and We
have sent down to you a vivid light.</item>
        <item>Now those who believe in Allah and hold on to Him - He
shall admit them into Mercy from Him, and Grace, and shall lead them
to Himself through a straight path.</item>
        <item>They seek a ruling from you. Say, “Allah gives you the
ruling concerning Kalalah . ⁶⁸ If a person dies having no son, but he
does have a sister, then, she will get one half of what he leaves. (On
the other hand) He will inherit her if she has no child. If they are
two (sisters), they will get two third of what he leaves. If they are
brothers and sisters, both male and female, then, the male will get a
share equal to that of two females.” Allah explains to you, lest you
should go astray. Allah has full knowledge of everything.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>O you who believe, fulfill the contracts. ¹The animals
from the cattle have been made lawful for you, except that which shall
be read over to you, ²provided that you do not treat hunting as lawful
while you are in Ihram. ³Surely, Allah ordains what He wills.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not violate (the sanctity) of the
Marks of Allah, ⁴ nor of the sacred month, ⁵ nor of the sacrificial
animal, nor of the garlands, ⁶ nor of those proceeding to the Sacred
House, seeking the grace of their Lord and (His) Pleasure. When you
are out of Ihram, you may hunt. Malice against a people for their
having prevented you from Al-Masjid-ul-Haram, should not cause you to
cross the limits. Help each other in righteousness and piety, and do
not help each other in sin and aggression. Fear Allah. Surely, Allah
is severe at punishment.</item>
        <item>Prohibited for you are: carrion, blood, the flesh of
swine, and those upon which (a name) other than that of Allah has been
invoked (at the time of slaughter), animal killed by strangulation, or
killed by a blow, or by a fall, or by goring, or that which is eaten
by a beast unless you have properly slaughtered it; and that which has
been slaughtered before the idols, and that you determine shares
through the arrows. ⁷ (All of) this is sin. Today those who disbelieve
have lost all hope of (damaging) your faith. So, do not fear them,
and fear Me. Today, I have perfected your religion for you, and have
completed My blessing upon you, and chosen Islam as DÍn (religion and
a way of life) for you. But whoever is compelled by extreme hunger,
having no inclination towards sin, ⁸ then Allah is Most-Forgiving,
Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>They ask you as to what has been made lawful for them.
Say, “Made lawful for you are good things, and (hunting through) birds
and beasts of prey that you train, teaching them out of what Allah has
taught you. So, eat of what they hold for you, ⁹ and recite the name of
Allah upon it.” Fear Allah. Surely, Allah is swift at reckoning.
</item>
        <item>This day, good things have been made lawful for you. The
food of the people of the Book is lawful for you, ¹⁰ and your food is
lawful for them, and good women from among believers, and good women
from among those who were given the Book before you, ¹¹ provided you
give them their dowers, binding yourself in marriage, neither going
for lust, nor having paramours. Whoever rejects Faith, his effort will
go to waste and, in the Hereafter, he will be among the losers.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, when you rise for Salah, (prayer)
wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, and make Mash (wiping
by hands) of your heads and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. If you
are in a state of major impurity, ¹² cleanse yourselves well (by
taking bath). If you are sick, or on a journey, or if one of you has
come after relieving himself, or you have had sexual contact with
women, and you find no water, then, go for some clean dust and wipe
your faces and hands with it. ¹³ Allah does not like to impose a
problem on you; He, rather likes to cleanse you and to complete His
favour upon you, so that you may be grateful.</item>
        <item>Remember Allah’s favour upon you and His covenant that
He has taken from you when you said, “We have listened and obeyed.”
Fear Allah. Allah is all-Aware of what lies in the hearts.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, be steadfast for (obeying the
commands of) Allah, (and) witnesses for justice. Malice against a
people should not prompt you to avoid doing justice. Do justice. That
is nearer to Taqwa. Fear Allah. Surely, Allah is All-Aware of what you
do.</item>
        <item>Allah has promised those who believe and do good deeds:
For them there is forgiveness and a great reward.</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - they are the
people of the Fire.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, remember Allah’s favour upon you,
when some people planned to lay their hands on you, and He kept their
hands away from you. ¹⁴ Fear Allah; and in Allah the believers should
place their trust.</item>
        <item>Allah has made the Children of Israel take a pledge. We
appointed twelve chiefs from among them. Allah said, “I am surely with
you. If you establish Salah, and pay Zakah, and believe in My
Messengers, and hold them in reverence, and advance to Allah a goodly
loan, ¹⁵ I shall certainly write off your evil deeds, and I shall
certainly admit you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow. So,
whoever from you disbelieves after that has lost the straight
path.”</item>
        <item>So, because they broke their pledge, We cursed them and
made their hearts hardened. They change words from their places, and
they have overlooked a good deal of the Advice they were given. Every
now and then you come across a certain treachery from all of them,
except a few. So, forgive them and forego. Indeed, Allah loves those
who are good in deeds.</item>
        <item>And from those who say, “We are Christians,” We took a
pledge. So, they have overlooked a good deal of the Advice they were
given. So, We had them stuck with enmity and malice among them right
through the Day of Doom, and (then) Allah will tell them what they
were doing.</item>
        <item>O people of the Book, there has come to you Our
Messenger disclosing to you much of what you have been concealing of
the Book, while He overlooks much. There has come to you, from Allah,
a Light and a clear Book;</item>
        <item>With it Allah guides those who follow His pleasure to
the pathways of peace, and brings them out, by His will, from the
depths of darkness into the light, and guides them to a straight path.
</item>
        <item>Certainly, infidels are those who say, “God is the
Masih, son of Maryam (Jesus son of Mary).” Say, “Who then has the
power to do anything against Allah, if He wills to eliminate the Masih
son of Maryam and his mother and all those on earth?” Unto Allah
belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lies between
them. He creates what He wills. Allah is powerful over everything.
</item>
        <item>The Jews and the Christians say, “We are the sons of
Allah and His favourites.” Say, “Why then would He punish you for your
sins? In fact, you are just human, among those He has created. He
forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills.” Unto Allah belongs
the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lies between them,
and unto Him is the return.</item>
        <item>O people of the Book, Our Messenger has come to you
making things clear to you after a gap between Messengers, ¹⁶ lest you
were to say, “There has not come to us a bearer of good news, and a
warner.” So, now there has come to you a bearer of good news, and a
warner. Allah is powerful over everything.</item>
        <item>Recall) when Musa said to his people, “O my people,
remember the blessing of Allah upon you when He made prophets from
among you, made you kings and gave you what He did not give to anyone
in the worlds.</item>
        <item>O my people, enter the Holy Land ¹⁷ which Allah has
destined for you, and do not turn back, lest you should turn
losers.”</item>
        <item>They said, “O Musa, there is a nation of tyrants over
there, and we shall never enter it until they get out of it. If they
do get out of it, we are ready to go in.”</item>
        <item>Said two men from among the God-fearing, on whom Allah
had bestowed His favour, ¹⁸ “Enter the gate (charging) upon them. Once
you have entered it, you will be the ones who will prevail. In Allah
you must place your trust, if you are believers.”</item>
        <item>They said, “O Musa, we shall never enter it, in any
case, so long as they are there. So go, you and your Lord, and fight.
As for us, we are sitting right here.”</item>
        <item>He said, “O my Lord, I have no control except over
myself and my brother. ¹⁹ So, make a distinction between us and the
sinning people.”</item>
        <item>He (Allah) said, “This (land) is prohibited to them for
forty years. They shall be wandering around the earth. ²⁰ So, do not
grieve for the sinning people.”</item>
        <item>And recite to them the story of the two sons of ’Adam
rightly: ²¹ When both of them offered a sacrifice, it was accepted
from one of them, and was not accepted from the other. He said, “I
will kill you.” He said, “Allah accepts only from the God-fearing.
</item>
        <item>If you stretch your hand towards me to kill me, I am not
going to stretch my hand towards you to kill you. Indeed, I fear
Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</item>
        <item>I would rather let you bear my sin and your sin, ²² and
then become one of the people of the Fire. That is the punishment of
the unjust.”</item>
        <item>Prohibited for you are: carrion, blood, the flesh of
swine, and those upon which (a name) other than that of Allah has been
invoked (at the time of slaughter), animal killed by strangulation, or
killed by a blow, or by a fall, or by goring, or that which is eaten
by a beast unless you have properly slaughtered it; and that which has
been slaughtered before the idols, and that you determine shares
through the arrows. ⁷ (All of) this is sin. Today those who disbelieve
have lost al</item>
        <item>Then, Allah sent a crow that scratched the earth to show
him how he should conceal the corpse of his brother. He said, “Alas!
Was I not even able to be like this crow so that I could conceal the
corpse of my brother? So, he stood regretful.</item>
        <item>For this reason, We decreed for the children of Isra’il
that whoever kills a person not in retaliation for a person killed,
nor (as a punishment) for spreading disorder on the earth, is as if he
has killed the whole of humankind, and whoever saves the life of a
person is as if he has saved the life of the whole of humankind.
Certainly, Our messengers have come to them with clear signs. Then,
after all that, many of them are there to commit excesses on the
earth.</item>
        <item>Those who fight against Allah and His Messenger and run
about trying to spread disorder on the earth, their punishment is no
other than that they shall be killed, or be crucified, or their hands
and legs be cut off from different sides, or they be kept away from
the land (they live in) ²³. That is a humiliation for them in this
world, and for them there is a great punishment in the Hereafter;
</item>
        <item>Except those who repent before you overpower them. Then,
be sure that Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful. ²⁴</item>
        <item>O you who believe, fear Allah and seek means of nearness
to Him, and carry out Jihad in His way, so that you may succeed.
</item>
        <item>Surely, if the disbelievers have all that is in the
earth, and more as much besides it, to pay it as ransom against the
punishment of the Day of Judgment, it shall not be accepted from them,
and they will have a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>They will wish to come out of the Fire, but they will
not be able to come out from there. For them there will be a lasting
punishment.</item>
        <item>As for a man or a woman who commits theft, cut off the
hands of both to punish them for what they earned,_a deterrent
punishment from Allah. Allah is Mighty, Wise.</item>
        <item>Whoever repents after his transgression and corrects
himself, then Allah shall relent towards him. ²⁵ Surely, Allah is MostForgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Do you not know that to Allah alone belongs the kingdom
of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whomsoever He wills and
forgives whomsoever He wills. Allah is powerful over everything.
</item>
        <item>O Messenger, those who race towards disbelief should not
be a cause of grief for you, be they from those who say with their
mouths, “We believe”, while their hearts do not believe, or from those
who are (pronounced) Jews. They are listeners to the fallacy,
listeners to other people who did not come to you. ²⁶ They distort the
words after they had been properly placed. ²⁷ They say, “If you are
given this, take it, and if you are not given this, then avoid it.”.”
²⁸ The one whom Allah wills to put to trial, you cannot do anything for
him against Allah. They are the ones whose hearts Allah did not intend
to purify. For them there is humiliation in this world, and for them
there is a great punishment in the Hereafter.</item>
        <item>They are listeners to the fallacy, devourers of the
unlawful. ²⁹ So, if they come to you, judge between them or turn away
from them. ³⁰ If you turn away from them, they can do you no harm. But
if you judge, judge between them with justice. Surely, Allah loves
those who do justice.</item>
        <item>How do they ask you to judge while the Torah is with
them, having the ruling of Allah? Still, they turn away, after all
that. They are no believers.</item>
        <item>Surely We have sent down the Torah, in which there was
guidance and light by which the prophets, who submitted themselves to
Allah, used to judge for the Jews, and (so did) the Men of Allah and
the Men of knowledge, because they were ordained to protect the Book
of Allah, and they stood guard over it. So, (O Jews of today,) do not
fear people. Fear Me, and do not take a paltry price for My verses.
Those who do not judge according to what Allah has sent down are the
disbelievers.</item>
        <item>We prescribed for them therein: A life for a life, an
eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear and a tooth for a
tooth; and for wounds, an equal retaliation. ³¹ Then, if one forgives
it, that will be expiation for him. Those who do not judge according
to what Allah has sent down, they are the unjust.</item>
        <item>We sent ‘Isa son of Maryam after those prophets,
confirming the Torah that was (revealed) before him, and We gave him
the Injil having guidance and light therein, and confirming the Torah
that was (revealed) before it; a guidance and a lesson for the Godfearing.</item>
        <item>And the people of the Injil must judge according to what
Allah has sent down therein. Those who do not judge according to what
Allah has sent down, they are the sinners.</item>
        <item>We have sent down to you the Book with truth, confirming
the Book before it, and a protector for it. So, judge between them
according to what Allah has sent down, and do not follow their desires
against the truth that has come to you. For each of you We have made a
law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made a single
community of people, but (He did not), so that He may test you in what
He has given to you. ³² Strive, then, to excel each other in good
deeds. To Allah is the return for all of you. Then Allah shall tell
you about that in which you disputed.i</item>
        <item>We order you to judge between them according to what
Allah has sent down. Do not follow their desires, and beware of them,
lest they should turn you away from some of what Allah has sent down
to you. If they turn away, be assured that Allah intends to make them
suffer for some of their sins. Surely, many of the people are sinners.
</item>
        <item>Is it, then, the judgement of (the days of) Ignorance
that they seek? Who is better in judgement than Allah, for a people
who believe?</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not take the Jews and the
Christians for intimate friends. ³³ They are friends to each other.
Whoever takes them as intimate friends is one of them. Surely, Allah
does not take the unjust people to the right path.</item>
        <item>Now, you see those who have disease in their hearts race
towards them saying, “We apprehend that some misfortune may overtake
us.” ³⁴ o, it is likely that Allah may bring victory or something else
from His own side, ³⁵ whereupon they will become regretful over what
they concealed in their hearts.</item>
        <item>Those who believe will say, “Are these the ones who
swore their solemn oaths by Allah that they were with you?” Their
deeds have gone to waste, and they became losers. ³⁶</item>
        <item>O you who believe, if anyone from you turns back from
his Faith, then Allah will bring a people whom He loves and who love
Him, humble toward the believers, hard on the disbelievers, who fight
in the way of Allah and are not afraid of the reproach of any critic.
That is a grace of Allah. He confers it on whom He wills. Allah is
All-Embracing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Your only friend is Allah, then His Messenger and those
who believe, who establish Salah and pay Zakah and bow before Allah.
</item>
        <item>Whoever maintains friendship with Allah and His
Messenger and those who believe (must know that) it is the (members of
the) Party of Allah that are the triumphant.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not take those who have taken your
Faith in jest and fun for friends from those who have been given the
Book prior to you, and the disbelievers. Fear Allah, if you are
believers.</item>
        <item>When you call for Salah, they take it in jest and fun.
That is because they are a people who do not understand.</item>
        <item>Say, “O People of the Book, do you accuse us of anything
else except that we have believed in Allah and in what has been sent
down to us and what has been sent down earlier while most of you are
sinners (and we do not follow you in your sins)</item>
        <item>Say, “Shall I tell you about the ones whose retribution
with Allah is worse than that (which you deem bad)? They are those
whom Allah has subjected to His curse and to His wrath; and He has
turned some of them into apes and swine, those who worshipped Taghut
(Satan, the Rebel). Those are worse in their situation, and far more
astray from the straight path.”</item>
        <item>When they come to you, they say, “We believe”, while
with disbelief they came in, and with the same (disbelief) they went
out. Allah knows best what they used to conceal.</item>
        <item>You will see many of them rushing towards sin and
aggression, and (towards) devouring what is unlawful. Evil indeed is
what they have been doing.</item>
        <item>Why do the Men of Allah and the Men of Knowledge not
forbid them from saying what is sinful and devouring what is unlawful?
Evil indeed is what they have been working.</item>
        <item>The Jews said, “Allah’s hand is fettered.” ³⁷ Fettered
are their own hands, and cursed are they for what they said. In fact,
His hands are outspread. He spends as He wills. What has been sent
down to you from your Lord shall certainly increase many of them in
rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred amongst them
lasting to the Day of Doom. ³⁸ Whenever they lit the flame of war,
Allah puts it out. They run about on the earth spreading mischief, ³⁹
and Allah does not like the mischief-makers.</item>
        <item>If the People of the Book had believed and feared Allah,
We would have written off their evil deeds and would have surely
admitted them to the Gardens of Bliss.</item>
        <item>If they had upheld the Torah and the Injil and what had
been sent down to them from their Lord, they would surely have had
plenty to eat from above them and from beneath them. Among them are
moderate people. ⁴⁰ As for most of them, evil is what they do.</item>
        <item>O Messenger, convey all that has been sent down to you
from your Lord. If you do not, then you shall not have conveyed His
message (at all). Allah shall protect you from the people. Surely,
Allah does not lead the disbelieving people to the right path.</item>
        <item>Say, “O people of the Book, you have nothing to stand
on, unless you uphold the Torah and the Injil and what has been sent
down to you from your Lord.” ⁴¹ What has been sent down to you from
your Lord will certainly make many of them more persistent in
rebellion and disbelief. So, do not grieve over the disbelieving
people.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who believe, and those who are Jews, and
the Sabians, and the Christians - whoever believes in Allah and the
Last Day, and acts righteously, shall have no fear, nor shall such
people grieve. ⁴²</item>
        <item>Certainly We took a pledge from the children of Isra’il
and sent Messengers to them. Whenever a Messenger went to them with
whatdid not meet their desires, they cried lie to some, and killed
others.</item>
        <item>They thought that no harm would follow. Therefore, they
became blind and deaf. Then, Allah accepted their repentance, but
again they turned blind and deaf, many of them. Allah is watchful of
what they do.</item>
        <item>Surely, disbelievers are those who say, “Allah is the
Masih, son of Maryam” while the Masih had said, “O children of Isra’il
, worshipAllah, my Lord and your Lord.” In fact, whoever ascribes any
partner to Allah, Allah has prohibited for him the Jannah (the
Paradise), and his shelter is the Fire, and there will be no
supporters for the unjust.</item>
        <item>Surely, disbelievers are those who say, “Allah is the
third of the three” ⁴³ while there is no god but One God. If they do
not desist from what they say, a painful punishment shall certainly
befall such disbelievers.</item>
        <item>Why then do they not turn to Allah in repentance and
seek His forgiveness, while Allah is most forgiving, very merciful?
</item>
        <item>The Masih, son of Maryam, is no more than a Messenger.
There have been messengers before him. His mother was very truthful.
Both of them used to eat food. Look how We explain signs to them, then
see how far they are turned away.</item>
        <item>Say, “Do you worship, besides Allah, what has no power
to do you harm or bring you benefit?” Allah is the All-Hearing, the
All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Say, O people of the Book, be not excessive in your
religion unjustly, ⁴⁴ and do not follow the desires of a people who
have already gone astray, misled many and lost the right path.</item>
        <item>On those who disbelieve from among the children of
Isra’il , a curse was pronounced by Dawud and ‘Isa, Son of Maryam. All
this because they disobeyed and used to cross the limits.</item>
        <item>They did not forbid each other from any evil they
committed. Evil indeed is what they have been doing.</item>
        <item>You see many of them take the infidels (the pagans) for
friends. Indeed, evil is what they have sent ahead for themselves, for
Allah is angry with them, and they are to remain in torment for ever.
</item>
        <item>If they believed in Allah, in the prophet, and in what
had been sent down to him, they would have not taken them (the pagans)
for friends, but many of them are sinners.</item>
        <item>And you will certainly find that the people most hostile
against the believers are the Jews and the ones who ascribe partners
to Allah. You will certainly find that the closest of them in
friendship with the believers are those who say, “We are Christians.”
⁴⁵ That is because among them there are priests and monks, ⁴⁶ and
because they are not arrogant.</item>
        <item>When they hear what has been sent down to the Messenger,
you will see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth
they have recognized. They say, “Our Lord, we have come to believe.
So, record us along with those who bear witness.</item>
        <item>What excuse do we have if we do not believe in Allah and
in the truth that has come to us, while we hope that our Lord will
admit us to the company of the righteous people?”</item>
        <item>So, because of what they said, Allah has awarded them
gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will live forever.
That is the reward of those who are good in their deeds.</item>
        <item>But those who disbelieved and denied Our signs, they are
the people of the Fire.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not hold as unlawful the good
things that Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. ⁴⁷
Verily, Allah does not like the transgressors.</item>
        <item>Eat from what Allah has provided you as good and lawful,
and fear Allah in whom you believe.</item>
        <item>Allah does not hold you accountable for your laghw
(ineffectual) oaths, but He does hold you accountable for the oath
with which you have bound yourself. ⁴⁸ Its expiation is to feed ten
poor persons at an average of what you feed your family with, or to
clothe them, or to free a slave. However, if someone cannot afford, he
has to fast for three days. That is expiation for the oaths that you
have sworn. Take care of your oaths. That is how Allah makes His signs
clear to you, so that you may be grateful.</item>
        <item>O you who believe! Wine, gambling, altars and divining
arrows ⁴⁹ are filth, made up by Satan. Therefore, refrain from it, so
that you may be successful.</item>
        <item>Satan wishes only to plant enmity and malice between you
through wine and gambling, and to prevent you from the remembrance of
Allah and from Salah. Would you, then, abstain?</item>
        <item>Obey Allah, obey the Messenger, and be heedful. If you
still turn back, be assured that the duty of Our Messenger is only to
convey the Message clearly.</item>
        <item>There is no sin, for those who believe and do good
deeds, in what they might have partaken earlier, ⁵⁰ if they fear Allah,
and believe, and do good deeds; and again fear Allah, and believe, and
still again fear Allah and do good deeds. ⁵¹ Allah loves those who are
good in their deeds.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, Allah shall certainly test you with
some of the game coming in the range of your hands and spears, so that
Allah may know those who fear Him, even though He is Unseen. ⁵² Whoever
transgresses the limit after all this, for him there is a painful
punishment.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not kill game when you are in
Ihram (state of consecration for Hajj or ‘Umrah). If someone from
among you kills it deliberately, then compensation (will be required)
from cattle equal to what one has killed, according to the judgement
of two just men from among you, as an offering due to reach the
Ka’bah, or an expiation, that is, to feed the poor, or its equal in
fasts, ⁵³ so that he may taste the punishment of what he did. Allah has
forgiven what has passe</item>
        <item>Made lawful for you is the game of the sea and eating
thereof, as a benefit for you and for travellers. But the game of the
land has been made unlawful for you as long as you are in the state of
Ihram. Fear Allah (the One) towards Whom you are to be brought
together.</item>
        <item>Allah has made the Ka’bah, the Sacred House, a source of
stability for people, ⁵⁴ and also the sacred month and the sacrificial
animal and the garlands. ⁵⁵ All this is because you may learn that
Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. Allah is
All-Knowing in respect of everything.</item>
        <item>Be sure that Allah is severe in punishment and that
Allah is Very-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>The duty of Our Messenger is only to convey the Message.
Allah knows what you disclose and what you conceal.</item>
        <item>Say, “The evil and the good are not equal, even though
the abundance of (what is) evil may attract you. So, fear Allah, O
people of understanding, so that you may be successful.”</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not ask about things which, if
disclosed, would displease you. If you ask about them while the Qur’an
is being revealed, they will be disclosed to you. ⁵⁶ Allah has pardoned
you for it. Allah is Most-Forgiving, Forbearing.</item>
        <item>People before you asked such questions, and then, as a
result, became disbelievers.</item>
        <item>Allah has made no Bahirah, no Sa’ibah, no Wasilah and no
Hami (names of animals dedicated to idols on different grounds). ⁵⁷ But
those who disbelieve coin a lie against Allah, and most of them do not
understand.</item>
        <item>When it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has sent
down, and to the Messenger;” they say, “Sufficient for us is that on
which we have found our forefathers.” Is it so, even though their
forefathers knew nothing, and had no guidance either?</item>
        <item>O you who believe, take care of your own selves. The one
who has gone astray cannot harm you, if you are on the right path. ⁵⁸
To Allah all of you have to return. Then He will tell you what you
have been doing.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, ⁵⁹ when death draws near one of you,
that is, at the time of making a will, the evidence (recognized)
between you shall be of two witnesses from among you, or of two others
not from you, ⁶⁰ if you are travelling on the earth and the trauma of
death visits you. (Then) you shall detain them after the prayer, if
you have some doubt, ⁶¹ and they shall swear by Allah, “We shall not
take a price for it, even if there be a relative; and</item>
        <item>Then, if it is discovered that the two had rendered
themselves liable to a sin, then, in their place shall stand two
others, closest of those whose right has been taken away, ⁶² and they
shall swear by Allah, “Our evidence is more truthful than their
evidence, and we have not transgressed; otherwise we should be among
the unjust.”</item>
        <item>Thus, it is more likely that the former people (i.e. the
executors of the bequest) will bear witness in its proper way, or they
will fear that oaths will be taken in rebuttal of their oaths. Fear
Allah and listen. Allah does not lead sinning people to the right
path.</item>
        <item>Be mindful of) the day when Allah will assemble the
messengers and will say to them, “How were you responded to?” They
will say, “We have no knowledge. ⁶³ Surely You alone have the full
knowledge of all that is unseen.”</item>
        <item>Call to mind the time) when Allah will say, “O ‘Isa, son
of Maryam, remember My blessing upon you and upon your mother; when I
supported you with the Holy Spirit. ⁶⁴ You spoke to people while you
were still in the cradle and when you grew to middle age. I taught you
the Book and the Wisdom, the Torah and the Injil. You created from
clay something in the shape of a bird, then you blew on it, and it
became a bird by My leave. You cured those born blind and lepers by My
leave. You r</item>
        <item>When I enjoined upon the disciples (of ‘Isa ), “Believe
in Me and in My Messenger,” they said, “We believed. Bear witness that
we are the submitting ones.”</item>
        <item>When the disciples said, “O ‘Isa, son of Maryam, can
your Lord send down to us a repast from the heavens?” He said, “Fear
Allah if you are believers.” ⁶⁵</item>
        <item>They said, “We wish that we eat from it, and our hearts
be satisfied, and we may know for sure that you have told us the
truth, and we may become witnesses to it.”</item>
        <item>Sa son of Maryam said, “O Allah, our Lord, send down to
us a repast from heaven which may be a happy occasion for us, for all
our generations present and future, and a sign from You, and give us
provisions. You are the best Giver of Provisions.”</item>
        <item>Allah said, “I am going to send it down to you; but
whoever among you disbelieves after that, I shall give him such a
punishment as I shall not give to anyone else in all the worlds.”
⁶⁶</item>
        <item>And when Allah said, “O ‘Isa, son of Maryam, did you say
to the people: ‘Take me and my mother as gods beside Allah?” He said,
“Pure are You, it does not behoove me to say what is not right for me.
Had I said it, You would have known it. You know what is in my heart,
and I do not know what is in Your’s. You alone have full knowledge of
all that is unseen.</item>
        <item>I have not said to them anything but what You have
ordered me to say, that is, ‘Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord’ and
I was a witness over them as long as I was with them. But when You
recalled me, You were the One watching over them. You are a witness
over everything.</item>
        <item>If You punish them, they are Your slaves after all, but
if You forgive them, You are the Mighty, the Wise.”</item>
        <item>Allah will say, “This is a day on which the truth of the
truthful shall benefit them. For them there are gardens beneath which
rivers flow, where they will live forever. Allah is well-pleased with
them and they are well-pleased with Him. That is the great
achievement.</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the
earth and of whatever lies therein, and He is powerful over
everything.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>All praise belongs to Allah who created the heavens and
the earth, and made darkness and light; yet those who disbelieve
equate (others) with their Lord.</item>
        <item>He is the One who created you from clay, then destined a
term. ¹The fixed term lies with Him, yet you are in doubt.</item>
        <item>He is the true God in the heavens and the earth. He
knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you
earn.</item>
        <item>Yet whenever a sign from the signs of their Lord comes
to them, they do nothing but turn away from it.</item>
        <item>So they rejected the truth when it came to them. Now
there shall come to them a full account of what they used to ridicule.
</item>
        <item>Have they not seen how many generations We have
destroyed prior to them__those whom We had given such a strong
position in the land as We did not give to you, and We poured on them
abundant rains from the sky, and made rivers flow beneath them? Then
We destroyed them because of their sins, and raised up another
generation after them.</item>
        <item>If We had sent down to you something written on paper,
and they had even touched it with their hands, still the disbelievers
would have said, “This is nothing but obvious magic.”</item>
        <item>They say, “Why is it that an angel has not been sent
down to him?” Had We sent down an angel, the whole matter would have
been closed, and thereafter no further time would have been allowed to
them. ²</item>
        <item>If We had made him an angel, We would have obviously
made him a man, and would have caused them the same confusion they are
causing now. ³</item>
        <item>Even before you (O Prophet,) many messengers were
ridiculed. Those who laughed at them were, then, besieged by what they
used to ridicule.</item>
        <item>Say, “Go about the earth, and see what was the fate of
those who rejected (the prophets).”</item>
        <item>Say, “To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and on
the earth?” Say, “To Allah.” He has prescribed Mercy for Himself. He
will surely gather you on the Day of Resurrection in which there is no
doubt. Those who have brought loss to themselves are not going to
believe.</item>
        <item>To Him belongs all that dwells in the night and the day.
He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Say, “Would I take as guardian someone other than Allah
Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and Who feeds others,
and is not fed by anyone?” Say, “I have been asked to be the first to
submit (to Him) and never to be one of those who ascribe partners to
Allah.”</item>
        <item>Say, “If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a
momentous day.”</item>
        <item>Whoever is spared from it (the punishment of that day)
is, indeed, blessed with His mercy. That is the manifest achievement.
</item>
        <item>If Allah causes you harm, there is no one to remove it
except He Himself; and if He causes you good, then He is powerful over
everything.</item>
        <item>He is Dominant over His servants, and He is the AllWise, the All-Aware.</item>
        <item>Say, “Whose testimony is the greatest?” Say, “Allah is
the witness between me and you, and this Qur’an has been revealed to
me so that I should thereby warn you, and whomsoever it may reach. Do
you really bear witness that there are other gods along with Allah?”
Say, “I bear no such witness.” Say, “In fact, He is one God. I disown
what you associate (with Him).”</item>
        <item>Those to whom We have given the Book recognize him (the
Messenger) as (certainly as) they would recognize their sons. ⁴Those
who have brought loss to themselves, they are not going to believe.
</item>
        <item>Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against
Allah or rejects His signs? Beware, the unjust shall not prosper.
</item>
        <item>Be mindful of) the Day We shall gather them together,
then We will say to those who associated partners with Allah, “Where
are those you claimed to be partners of Allah?”</item>
        <item>Then, they will have no other mischievous move but that
they will say, “By Allah, our Lord, we ascribed no partners to
Allah.”</item>
        <item>See how they will lie about themselves, and all that
they used to forge will vanish from them. ⁵</item>
        <item>There are those among them who (apparently) listen to
you, but We have put coverings on their hearts, so that they do not
understand, and heaviness in their ears. ⁶If they were to see all the
signs, they would still not believe in them, so much so that, when
they come to quarrel with you, the disbelievers say (of the Qur’an),
“It is nothing but tales of the ancients.”</item>
        <item>From it (the Qur’an) they prevent others, and from it
they keep themselves away. They ruin none but their own selves, while
they do not realize it.</item>
        <item>If only you could (be there to) see when they will be
made to stand by the Fire, and they will say, “Would that we were sent
back, then we would not reject the signs of our Lord, and would join
the believers.”</item>
        <item>In fact, what they were concealing earlier will become
clear to them. ⁷If they were sent back, they would again go for what
they were forbidden from, as they are sheer liars.</item>
        <item>They say, “There is nothing but this worldly life of
ours, and we are not going to be raised again.”</item>
        <item>If only you could see when they will be made to stand
before their Lord! He will say, “Is this not true?” They will say, “Of
course, by our Lord, it is.” He will say, “Then, taste the punishment,
for you used to disbelieve.”</item>
        <item>Losers indeed are those who deny that they will ever
face Allah, until when the Hour will come upon them suddenly, they
will say, “Alas! We have been negligent about it.” They shall carry
their burdens on their backs. Beware! Evil is the burden they carry.
</item>
        <item>The worldly life is nothing but a game and fun, ⁸and the
last abode is surely much better for those who fear Allah. Would you
still not understand?</item>
        <item>Indeed We know that what they say makes you sad, because
it is not you whom they reject, but the transgressors actually deny
the signs of Allah.</item>
        <item>Indeed, many messengers have been rejected before you,
but they stood patient against their rejection, and they were
persecuted until Our help came to them. No one can change the words of
Allah, ⁹and of course, some accounts of the messengers have already
come to you.</item>
        <item>If their aversion is too hard on you, then seek, if you
can, a tunnel into the earth or a ladder unto the sky in order to
bring them a sign. Had Allah so willed, He would have brought all of
them to the right path. ¹⁰So, never be one of the ignorant.</item>
        <item>Only those respond who listen (to seek the truth). As
for the dead, Allah shall raise them, after which they shall be
returned to Him.</item>
        <item>They say, “Why is it that no sign (of our choice) has
been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, “Allah is surely powerful
enough to send down a sign.” But most of them do not know.</item>
        <item>There is no creature moving on the earth, nor a bird
flying on its two wings, but they are all communities like you. We
have not missed anything in the Book. Then, to their Lord all of them
shall be gathered. ¹¹</item>
        <item>Those who gave the lie to Our signs are deaf and dumb,
in layers of darkness. He lets whomsoever He wills go astray, and
brings whomsoever He wills on the straight path. ¹²</item>
        <item>Say, “Tell me if the punishment of Allah comes to you or
the Hour befalls you, would you call someone other than Allah, if you
are truthful?”</item>
        <item>Rather, Him alone you will call and He, if He wills,
shall remove what you call Him for, and you will forget those you
associate with Him.</item>
        <item>We did send messengers to communities before you and put
them to hardships and sufferings, so that they may supplicate in
humility.</item>
        <item>Why then, did they not supplicate in humility when a
calamity from Us came upon them? ¹³Instead, their hearts were hardened
and Satan adorned for them what they were doing.</item>
        <item>Thereafter, when they forgot the advice they were given,
We opened for them doors of everything, so that when they became proud
of what they were given, We seized them suddenly and they were left in
despair.</item>
        <item>Thus, the people who did wrong were uprooted to the last
man; Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</item>
        <item>Say, “Tell me, if Allah takes away your hearing and your
sights and sets a seal on your hearts, which god other than Allah can
bring these back to you?” See how We put forth Our verses in various
forms? Yet, still they turn away.</item>
        <item>Say, “Tell me if the punishment of Allah comes upon you
whether suddenly or openly, shall any people be destroyed except the
unjust?’</item>
        <item>We do not send the messengers but as bearers of good
tidings and as warners. So, those who believe and correct themselves,
there will be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve,</item>
        <item>Whereas those who have rejected Our signs, torment shall
afflict them, because they used to commit sins.</item>
        <item>Say, “I do not say to you that I have the treasures of
Allah, nor do I have the knowledge of the Unseen, nor do I say to you
that I am an angel. I only follow what is revealed to me.” Say, “Are
the blind and the seeing alike? Do you, then, not reflect?”</item>
        <item>Warn, with it, those who have the fear of being gathered
before their Lord, with no one other than Him to support or to
intercede. Maybe they become God-fearing.</item>
        <item>Do not expel those who call out to their Lord morning
and evening seeking His pleasure. ¹⁴You are not responsible for
anything in their account, and they are not responsible for anything
in your account, that you should expel them, and thus become one of
the unjust.</item>
        <item>Thus We have tested some of them through others, so that
they should say, “Are these the ones among all of us whom Allah has
chosen for His favour?” Yes, does Allah not know well who are the
grateful?</item>
        <item>When those who believe in Our verses come to you, say to
them, “Peace on you. Your Lord has prescribed for Himself mercy, so
that if any one of you does an evil deed out of ignorance and
thereafter repents and mends his ways, then (you will see that) He is
Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>This is how We explain the verses in detail, so that the
way of the guilty may become exposed.</item>
        <item>Say, “I have been forbidden from worshiping those whom
you invoke beside Allah.” Say, “I do not follow your desires, because
if I were to do that, I would be going astray and would no more be of
those on the right path.”</item>
        <item>Say, “I am on clear guidance from my Lord, and you have
cried lies to it. That which you demand to be hastened is not up to
me. ¹⁵The Decision belongs to none but Allah. He relates the Truth and
He is the best of all judges.</item>
        <item>Say, “If what you demand to be hastened were up to me,
the matter between me and you would have been over. Allah well knows
who the wrongdoers are.</item>
        <item>With Him are the keys of the Unseen. No one knows them
but He. He knows what is in the land and the sea. No leaf ever falls
but that He knows about it, and there is no grain in the dark layers
of the earth, or anything fresh or dry that is not recorded in a
manifest book.</item>
        <item>He is the One who recalls your souls by night, and knows
what you do by day; then He makes you rise up therein, so that a fixed
term may be fulfilled. Thereafter, to Him are you to return; then He
will tell you what you have been doing.</item>
        <item>He is Dominant over His slaves, and He sends guardians
over you ¹⁶until when death comes upon one of you, Our deputies take
his soul in full, and they neglect nothing (from their duties).</item>
        <item>Then all of them will be returned to Allah, their real
Master. Behold, His is the judgement, and He is the swiftest of those
who take account.</item>
        <item>Say, “Who is the One who delivers you from the darkness
of the land and the sea when you supplicate Him in humility and in low
tones (promising): ‘If He delivers us from this, We shall truly become
grateful?’” ¹⁷</item>
        <item>Say, “Allah delivers you from it and from every pain;
Yet still, you associate partners with Him.”</item>
        <item>Say, “He is fully capable that He should send a
punishment from above you or from beneath your feet, or to put you in
confusion through divisions, and make some of you taste troubles
through some others. ¹⁸See how We bring forth explaining verses from
different angles, so that they may understand.</item>
        <item>Your people have rejected it (the Qur’an) while it is
the whole truth. Say, “I am not appointed as a taskmaster over you.
¹⁹</item>
        <item>For every event there is a point (of time and place) to
occur, and you will soon know (it).”</item>
        <item>When you see those who indulge in (blaspheming) Our
verses, turn away from them until they become occupied with some other
discourse. If Satan should cause you to forget (this instruction),
then do not sit with the unjust people after recollection.</item>
        <item>Those who fear Allah are not responsible for any (evil)
act in the account of these (infidels), except for advising them, so
that they may be careful.</item>
        <item>Avoid those who have taken their faith as fun and games.
The worldly life has deceived them. Preach with it (the Qur’an), lest
one should be seized for what he did, in a way that he should have
neither a helper besides Allah, nor an intercessor. Should he offer
every (sort of) ransom, it will not be accepted from him. Those are
the ones who are seized for what they themselves earned. For them
there is a drink of boiling water, and a painful punishment, because
they used to disbelieve.</item>
        <item>Say, “Should we invoke, besides Allah, something that
can neither benefit us nor harm us? Should we turn back on our heels
after Allah has guided us? (If we do so, we will be) like the one whom
the devils have abducted to a far off land, leaving him bewildered,
even though he has friends who call him to the right path (saying),
“Come to us.” Say, “Allah’s guidance is the guidance, and we have been
ordered to submit to the Lord of the worlds,</item>
        <item>And establish Salah, and heed Him. He is the One before
whom you are to be gathered.</item>
        <item>He is the One who created the heavens and the earth with
purpose. On the day He says “Be”, it (the Resurrection) will come to
be. His word is the truth, and His is the kingdom on the day the Horn
shall be blown. He is the Knower of the Unseen and the Seen. He is the
Wise, the All-Aware.</item>
        <item>Remember) ²⁰ when Ibrahim said to his father, ’Azar: “Do
you take idols for gods? I see you and your people in manifest
error.”</item>
        <item>Thus We showed Ibrahim the kingdom of the heavens and
the earth, so that he might be firm in belief.</item>
        <item>So, when the night enveloped him, he saw a star. He
said, “This is my Lord.” ²¹But, when it vanished, he said, “I do not
like those who vanish.”</item>
        <item>Later, when he saw the moon rising, he said, “This is my
Lord.” But, when it vanished, he said, “Had my Lord not guided me, I
would have been among those gone astray.”</item>
        <item>Thereafter, when he saw the sun rising, he said, “This
is my Lord. This is greater.” Again, when it vanished, he said, “O my
people, I disown whatever you associate with Allah.</item>
        <item>I have, indeed, turned my face straight towards the One
who created the heavens and the earth, and I am not one of those who
associate partners with Allah.”</item>
        <item>His people argued with him. He said, “Do you argue with
me about Allah while He has already led me to the right path? I do not
fear that which you associate with Him, (because it cannot harm me),
unless, of course, something is willed by my Lord. My Lord encompasses
everything with His knowledge. Would you, then, take no lesson?</item>
        <item>How can I fear that which you associate with Him, while
you do not fear (the evil fate of) your having associated with Allah
something for which He did not send down to you any authority? Now,
which of the two parties has more right to be in peace? (Tell me) if
you know.</item>
        <item>Those who have believed and have not mixed their faith
with injustice are the ones who deserve peace, and it is they who are
on the right path.</item>
        <item>That is the decisive argument from Us that We gave to
Ibrahim against his people. We raise in ranks whomsoever We will.
Surely, your Lord is Wise, Knowing.</item>
        <item>We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Ya‘qub . Each one of them
We guided to the right path. Earlier, We guided Nuh and, of his
progeny, (We guided) Dawud and Sulaiman and Ayyub and Yusuf (Joseph)
and Musa and Harun.__Thus We reward those who are good in
deeds__</item>
        <item>And (We guided) Zakariyya and Yahya and ‘Isa and Ilyas
__each one of them was of the righteous__</item>
        <item>And Isma‘il and Yasa‘ and Yunus and Lut, and all of them
We made to excel over all the people of the world (in their respective
times).</item>
        <item>We guided many among their fathers and their children
and their brothers, and We chose them and led them on to the straight
path.</item>
        <item>That is Allah’s guidance. He guides with it whomsoever
He wills from among His servants. Had they associated partners with
Him, all they did would have been nullified for them.</item>
        <item>They are those whom We have given the Book and wisdom
and prophethood. So, if these people disbelieve this (concept of
Prophet-hood), then (be not grieved, because) We have deputed for
(believing in) it a people who do not reject it.</item>
        <item>Those are the people whom Allah has guided. So, it is
their guidance that you should follow. Say, “I ask you no reward for
it. It is nothing but an advice for all the worlds.”</item>
        <item>They did not hold Allah in due esteem when they said,
“Allah has not sent down anything to a human being.” ²²Say, “Who has
sent down the Book brought by Musa as a light and a guidance for
people, which you keep in various sheets (some of which) you disclose,
and a lot of which you conceal, and (by which) you were taught what
you did not know, neither you nor your fathers?” Say, “Allah.” Then
leave them to play with whatever they indulge in.</item>
        <item>This is indeed a Blessed Book We have sent down,
confirming what was (revealed) before it, so that you may warn the
town which is the Mother of All Towns, (i.e. Makkah) and those around
it. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they take
due care of their prayers.</item>
        <item>Who is more unjust than the one who fabricates a lie
against Allah or says, “Revelation has been sent to me”, whereas no
revelation has been sent to him, and the one who says, “I would
produce the like of what Allah has revealed.” If only you could
witness when the unjust are in the throes of death, and the angels
stretch their hands (and say), “Out with your souls. Today, you shall
have your punishment, a punishment of humiliation, because you have
been saying about Allah what is not true, and have been showing
arrogance against His verses.”</item>
        <item>You have come to Us all alone, just as We had first
created you, and you have left behind you what We had bestowed on you,
and We do not see your intercessors with you - those whom you claimed
to be (Our) partners in (managing) your matters. In fact, all ties
between you are now severed, and all that you presumed has totally
failed you.</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah is the one who splits the grain and the
date-stone (for sprouting). He brings forth the living from the dead,
and He is the One who brings forth the dead from the living. ²³That is
Allah! To where, then, are you being turned away (by your desires)?
</item>
        <item>He is) the One who causes the dawn to break. He has made
the night for rest, and the sun and the moon for reckoning. This is a
measure set by the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>He is the One who made for you the stars, so that you
may be guided by them in darkness of the land and the sea. We have
elaborated the signs for the people who know.</item>
        <item>He is the One who created you from one person, then, you
have a place to dwell and a place to sojourn. We have elaborated the
signs for the people who understand.</item>
        <item>He is the One who sent down water from the heavens. Then
We brought forth with it vegetation of all kinds. Then from it We
brought grains set upon one another. From the palm-trees, from their
spathes, come forth the low hanging bunches. (We produce) vineyards
and the olive and the pomegranate, either similar or not similar to
each other. Look at its fruit when it bears fruit, and at its
ripening. Surely, in all this there are signs for the people who
believe.</item>
        <item>They have invented the Jinns as partners with Allah,
while He has created them; and they have fabricated for Him sons and
daughters without any knowledge. Pure is He, and far more higher than
what they describe.</item>
        <item>He is) the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How
can He have a son when He never had a wife? He created everything, and
He knows everything.</item>
        <item>This is Allah: your Lord, there is no God but He, the
Creator of everything; so, worship Him. He is Guardian over
everything.</item>
        <item>No vision can comprehend Him, and He comprehends all
visions, and He is Absolutely Subtle, ²⁴All-Aware.</item>
        <item>Say, O Prophet :) There have come to you insights from
your Lord. Now, whoever uses his sight, does so for his own self, and
whoever remains blind does so against his own self. I do not stand
guard over you.</item>
        <item>This is how We bring the verses in diverse ways, so that
they say, “you have been tutored”, ²⁵and so that We may explain it to
people who have knowledge.</item>
        <item>Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord.
There is no god but He; and turn away from those who associate
partners with Allah.</item>
        <item>If Allah willed, they would not have associated. We have
not appointed you as a guard over them, nor are you a taskmaster for
them.</item>
        <item>Do not revile those whom they invoke other than Allah,
lest they should revile Allah in transgression without having
knowledge. ²⁶This is how We have made the deeds of every community
attractive in their sight. Then, to their Lord is their return, after
which He shall tell them what they have been doing.</item>
        <item>They have sworn forceful oaths by Allah that if a sign
comes to them, they will surely believe in it. Say, “Signs are in
Allah’s power alone.” What will make you realize that even when they
(the signs) come, they will not believe?</item>
        <item>We will upset their hearts and sights, as they did not
believe in them at the first instance, and We will leave them
wandering blindly in their rebellion.</item>
        <item>If We had sent down to them the angels, and the dead had
spoken to them, and (even if) We had gathered everything before them
face to face, still, they were not to believe, unless Allah would have
so willed. But, most of them adopt the way of ignorance.</item>
        <item>So it is that, for every prophet, We have set up
enemies,__the devils of mankind and jinn__who seduce one another with
alluring rhetoric in order to deceive__Had Allah willed, they would
have not done it. So, leave them alone with what they forge__</item>
        <item>And (they seduce one another) in order that the hearts
of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to it, and
that they may be well pleased with it, and so that they commit what
those (seducers) are used to commit.</item>
        <item>So, should I seek someone other than Allah as judge,
while it is He who has sent down to you the Book in details? Those We
have given the Book know that it is revealed from your Lord with the
truth. So, never be one of those who are in suspicion.</item>
        <item>The Word of your Lord is perfect in truth and justice.
None is there to change His words, and He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
</item>
        <item>If you obey the majority of those on earth, they will
make you lose the way of Allah. They follow nothing but whims, and
they do nothing but make conjectures.</item>
        <item>Surely, your Lord is best aware of those who go astray
from His way, and He is best aware of those who are on the right path.
</item>
        <item>So, eat (the flesh) of that (animal) upon which the name
of Allah has been invoked (when slaughtering), if you do believe in
His verses. ²⁷</item>
        <item>What should cause you to avoid eating of that upon which
the name of Allah has been invoked, while He has spelled out to you
all that He has made unlawful for you, except that to which you are
compelled by extreme necessity? ²⁸Surely, there are many who misguide
people on the basis of their desires without having knowledge. Surely,
your Lord is the best knower of those who cross the limits.</item>
        <item>Leave outward sin and inward sin. ²⁹Surely, those who
commit sin shall be punished for what they used to commit.</item>
        <item>Do not eat that (meat) over which the name of Allah has
not been pronounced. This is surely a sin. The satans inspire their
friends to dispute with you. If you were to obey them, you would be
Mushriks. ³⁰</item>
        <item>Is it (conceivable) that the one who was dead and to
whom We gave life, and set for him a light with which he walks among
men, (is held to) be like the one whose condition is such that he is
in total darkness, never coming out of it? This is how their deeds
appear beautified to the disbelievers. ³¹</item>
        <item>In a similar way, in every town We caused its chief
sinners to commit mischief in it. And they do not commit mischief but
against themselves, while they do not realize it.</item>
        <item>When a sign comes to them, they say, “We shall never
come to believe unless we are given the like of what was given to the
messengers of Allah.” ³²Allah knows best where to place His message.
Those who committed sin shall soon suffer from disgrace before Allah
and face severe punishment for the mischief they have been making.
</item>
        <item>So, whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He makes his heart
wide open for Islam, and whomsoever He wills to let go astray, He
makes his heart strait and constricted, (and he feels embracing Islam
as difficult) as if he were climbing to the sky. In this way, Allah
lays abomination on those who do not believe.</item>
        <item>This is the path of your Lord, a straight path. We have
made the verses elaborate for people who accept the advice.</item>
        <item>For them there is the Abode of Peace with their Lord,
and He is their Guardian by virtue of what they used to do.</item>
        <item>The day He will assemble all of them together, (Allah
will say to Jinn) “O species of Jinns, you have done too much against
mankind.” ³³Their friends from among the human beings will say, “Our
Lord, some of us have benefited from others, ³⁴and we have reached our
term that You had appointed for us.” He will say, “The Fire is your
Abode wherein you will remain for ever, unless Allah wills
(otherwise). Surely, your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.”</item>
        <item>Thus We will make some wrongdoers companions of others
(in the Hereafter) because of what they used to commit.</item>
        <item>O species of Jinn and mankind, had the messengers not
come to you, from among yourselves, who used to relate My verses to
you, and used to warn you of the encounter of this your day?” They
will say, “We testify against ourselves.” The worldly life had
deceived them, and they will testify against themselves that they were
disbelievers.</item>
        <item>That (Allah sends messengers) is because your Lord is
not to destroy any towns on account of any wrongdoing, while their
people are unaware. ³⁵</item>
        <item>For all people, there are ranks according to what they
did, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do.</item>
        <item>Your Lord is the All-Independent, the Lord of Mercy. If
He so wills, He can take you away and cause whomsoever He wills to
succeed you, just as He has raised you from the progeny of other
people.</item>
        <item>Surely what you are promised is bound to come, and you
cannot frustrate (it).</item>
        <item>Say, “O my people, do at your place (whatever you do.) I
have to do (in my way). So, you will know for whom is the ultimate
abode. Surely, the wrongdoers will not be successful.”</item>
        <item>They have assigned a portion for Allah from the tillage
and the cattle created by Him, and then said, “This is for Allah”, so
they claim, “And this is for our associate-gods.” Then, that which is
allocated for their associate-gods never reaches Allah, while that
which is allocated for Allah does reach their associate-gods. Evil is
what they judge. ³⁶</item>
        <item>Similarly, their associate-gods have made the killing of
their children ³⁷seem fair to many mushriks (idolators), so that they
may ruin them and may confuse their faith for them. Had Allah so
willed, they would not have done that. So, leave them alone with what
they fabricate.</item>
        <item>They say, “These are prohibited cattle and produce; none
can eat them except those whom we wish” - so they claimed - “and there
are cattle whose backs are prohibited (for riding or loading)”, and
there are cattle over which they do not pronounce the name of
Allah,__all being fabrications against Him. He will soon punish them
for what they have been fabricating.</item>
        <item>They say, “Whatever is in the wombs of these cattle is
purely for our males, and forbidden to our wives.” If it be born dead,
then all of them share in it. ³⁸Soon, He will punish them for what they
attribute. Surely, He is All-Wise, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Losers are those who kill their children foolishly,
without knowledge, and hold as prohibited what Allah has provided
them, falsely ascribing it to Allah. They have gone astray, and they
are not on the right path.</item>
        <item>He is the One who has created gardens, trellised and
untrellised, and date-palms and crops with a variety of edibles, and
the olive and the pomegranate, (some) similar to one another, and
(some) dissimilar. Eat of its fruit when it bears fruits, and pay its
due on the day of harvest, and do not be extravagant. Surely, Allah
does not like the extravagant.</item>
        <item>Among cattle (He has created) those fit for loading and
those fit for laying on the floor ³⁹. Eat of what Allah has provided
you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Surely, he is an open
enemy to you.</item>
        <item>Allah has created) eight pairs: two of sheep and two of
goats. Say, “Is it the two males that He has prohibited or the two
females, or whatever the wombs of the two females contain? Tell me on
the basis of knowledge if you are true.”</item>
        <item>And (He has created) two of camels and two of oxen. Say,
“Is it the two males that He has prohibited or the two females or
whatever the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you present
when Allah has advised you of this?” ⁴⁰So, who is more unjust than the
one who fabricates a lie against Allah in order to misguide people
without knowledge? Surely, Allah gives no guidance to an unjust
people.</item>
        <item>Say, “I do not find, in what has been revealed to me,
anything (out of the cattle under discussion) prohibited for anyone
who eats it, unless it be carrion or blood that pours forth, or flesh
of swine - because it is impure - or there be an animal slaughtered
sinfully by invoking on it the name of someone other than Allah.
However, if anyone is compelled by necessity, neither seeking pleasure
nor crossing the limit, then your Lord is Most-Forgiving, VeryMerciful.” ⁴¹</item>
        <item>For those who are Jews We prohibited all that has claws.
Of cows and goats, We prohibited for them their fats, except that
which is borne by their backs or the entrails, or what is attached to
a bone. ⁴²Thus We recompensed them for their transgression. We are
definitely truthful.</item>
        <item>Then, if they give the lie to you, say, “Your Lord is
the Lord of all-embracing mercy, and His punishment cannot be averted
from the sinning people.”</item>
        <item>Those who associate partners with Allah will say, “Had
Allah willed, we would have not associated (partners with Him), nor
our fathers, nor would we have made anything prohibited.” In the same
way those who went before them gave the lie to (the truth) until they
tasted Our punishment. Say, “Do you have any sure knowledge that you
may produce to us? You follow nothing but whims, and do nothing but
make conjectures.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Then, Allah’s is the conclusive proof. So, had He
willed, He would have brought all of you on the right path”. ⁴³</item>
        <item>Say, “Bring your witnesses who testify that Allah has
prohibited this.” Then, if they testify, (O prophet), do not be a
witness to them, and do not follow the desires of those who have given
the lie to Our signs and those who do not believe in the Hereafter,
and who equate others with their Lord.</item>
        <item>Say (O Prophet to the infidels), “Come, and I shall
recite what your Lord has prohibited for you: Do not associate
anything with Him (as His partner); and be good to parents, and do not
kill your children because of poverty - We will give provision to you,
and to them as well - and do not go near shameful acts, whether they
are open or secret; and do not kill a person whom Allah has given
sanctity, except rightfully. This He has enjoined upon you, so that
you may understand.</item>
        <item>Do not approach the property of the orphan, except with
the best possible conduct, until he reaches maturity. Give full
measure and full weight in all fairness ⁴⁴- We do not obligate anyone
beyond his capacity - ⁴⁵and be just when you speak, even though the one
(against whom you are speaking) is a relative; and fulfill the
covenant of Allah. This is what He has enjoined upon you, so that you
may observe the advice.</item>
        <item>And: This is My path that is straightforward. So, follow
it, and do not follow the (other) ways, lest they should make you
deviate from His way. This is what He has enjoined upon you, so that
you may be God-fearing.”</item>
        <item>Then We gave Musa the Book, perfect for the one who does
good, and explaining everything in detail, and a guidance and mercy,
so that they may believe in meeting their Lord.</item>
        <item>And this (Qur’an) is a blessed Book We have sent down.
So follow it and fear Allah, so that you may be favored with mercy.
</item>
        <item>Had We not sent this book,) you would (have an excuse
to) say, “The Book was sent down only upon two groups before us, (i.e.
the Jews and the Christians) and we were unaware of what they
read.”</item>
        <item>Or you would say, “If the Book had been sent down to us,
we would have been more adhering to the right path than they are.” Now
there has come to you a clear sign from your Lord, and a guidance and
mercy. So, who is more unjust than the one who gives the lie to the
verses of Allah and turns away from them? We will recompense those who
turn away from Our verses with an evil punishment, because of their
turning away.</item>
        <item>They are waiting for nothing less than that the angels
should come to them, or your Lord or some signs of your Lord should
come. The day some signs of your Lord will come, the believing of a
person shall be of no use to him who had never believed before, or had
not earned some good through his faith. Say, “Wait. Of course, we are
waiting.”</item>
        <item>Surely, those who have made divisions in their religion
and turned into factions, you have nothing to do with them. Their case
rests with Allah alone; then He will tell them what they have been
doing.</item>
        <item>Whoever comes with a good deed will receive ten times as
much, and whoever comes with an evil deed will be requited with no
more than the like of it, and they shall not be wronged.</item>
        <item>Say, “As for me, my Lord has guided me to a straight
path, the straight religion, the faith of Ibrahim who was upright and
was not of those who associate partners with Allah.</item>
        <item>Say, “My prayer, my offering, my life and my death are
for Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.</item>
        <item>For Him there is no partner. And thus I have been
commanded, and I am the first one to submit.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Should I seek a lord other than Allah while He is
the Lord of everything? And nobody does anything but to his own
account, and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another.
Then to your Lord is your return. Then He will let you know what you
were disputing about.”</item>
        <item>It is He who made you the vicegerents of the earth and
raised some of you in ranks over others, so that He may test you in
what He has given you. Surely, your Lord is swift in punishing, and
surely He is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Alif, Lam, Mim, Sad. ¹</item>
        <item>This is) a book sent down to you. Therefore, your heart
must not be straitened because of it. ²(It is revealed to you) so that
you may warn through it, and it may be an advice for the believers.
</item>
        <item>O humankind,) follow what has been sent down to you from
your Lord, and do not follow any masters other than Him. ³Little you
heed to advice!</item>
        <item>How many a town We have destroyed! Our punishment came
upon them at night or when they were having a nap at midday.</item>
        <item>So, when Our punishment came upon them, they could say
nothing but cry, “We were wrongdoers indeed.”</item>
        <item>So, We shall ask those to whom the messengers were sent,
and We shall ask the messengers (how they conveyed the message).
</item>
        <item>Then, having full knowledge, We shall tell them the
whole story, as We were never far from them.</item>
        <item>The Weighing (of deeds) on that day is definite. ⁴As for
those whose scales are heavy, they will be the successful ones.</item>
        <item>But those whose scales are light, they are the ones who
have brought loss to themselves, because they did not do justice to
Our verses.</item>
        <item>We established you on earth, and created in it means of
living for you. Little you appreciate.</item>
        <item>We created you, then gave you a shape, then We said to
the angels, “Prostrate yourselves before ’Adam.” So, they all
prostrated themselves, except Iblis (Satan). He did not join those who
fell prostrate.</item>
        <item>Allah said, “What has prevented you from prostrating
when I ordered you?” He said, “I am better than him. You have created
me of fire, and created him of clay.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Then, get you down from here, it is not for
you to show arrogance here. So, get out. You are one of the degraded.
</item>
        <item>He said, “Then give me respite until a day when all will
be resurrected.</item>
        <item>He (Allah) said, “You are granted respite’’.</item>
        <item>He said, “Now that You have led me astray, I will
certainly sit for them (in ambush) on Your straight path.</item>
        <item>Then I will come upon them from their front side and
from their behind, and from their right and from their left. You will
not find most of them grateful.</item>
        <item>He (Allah) said, “Get out of here, condemned, rejected.
Indeed, whosoever will follow you from among them, I will fill Hell
with all of you together.</item>
        <item>O ’Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise, and eat
from wherever you like, but do not go near this tree, otherwise you
shall join the transgressors.”</item>
        <item>Then Satan whispered to them, so that he might expose to
them their shame that was hidden from them; and said, “Your Lord has
not prohibited this tree for you, but to avoid your becoming angels or
your becoming eternal.” ⁵</item>
        <item>He declared to them on oath, “I am one of your wellwishers.”</item>
        <item>Thus, he cast both of them down by deception. When they
tasted (the fruit of) the tree, their shame was exposed to them, ⁶nd
they began to patch together some leaves of Paradise upon themselves,
and their Lord called them, “Did I not forbid you from that tree? Did
I not tell you that Satan is your declared enemy?”</item>
        <item>They said, “Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if
You do not forgive us and do not bless us with mercy, we shall,
indeed, be among the losers. ⁷</item>
        <item>He said, “Go down, some of you enemies of some; and for
you on the earth there will be a dwelling place and enjoyment for a
time.”</item>
        <item>Further) He said, “There you shall live and there you
shall die, and from there you shall be raised again.”</item>
        <item>O children of ’Adam, We have sent down to you the dress
that covers your shame and provides adornment. As for the dress of
Taqwa (piety), that is the best. ⁸That is one of the signs of Allah, so
that they may learn a lesson.</item>
        <item>O children of ’Adam, “Do not let Satan put you in
trouble the way he had your parents expelled from Paradise, having
their dress removed from them, so that he could show them their shame.
Indeed, he sees you _ he and his company _ from where you do not see
them. Surely, We have made the devils friends to those who do not
believe.</item>
        <item>When they do a shameful act, they say, “We have found
our fathers doing it, and Allah has ordered us to do so.” Say, “Allah
never orders anything shameful. Do you say about Allah what you do not
know?”</item>
        <item>Say, “My Lord has ordered me to do justice.” ⁹Set your
faces aright on each occasion of prostration, and pray to Him with
pure faith in Him. Just as He has originated you, so you will be
raised again.</item>
        <item>He has led a group to guidance; and established for
another group is misguidance. Indeed, they have taken the devils for
their friends, instead of Allah, and they think that they are on the
right path.</item>
        <item>O children of ’Adam, take on your adornment at every
mosque. ¹⁰Eat and drink and do not be extravagant. Surely, He does not
like the extravagant.</item>
        <item>Say, “Who has prohibited the adornment Allah has brought
forth for His servants, and the wholesome things of sustenance?”Say,
“They are for the believers during this worldly life (though shared by
others), while they are purely for them on the day of Resurrection.
¹¹This is how We elaborate the verses for people who
understand.”</item>
        <item>Say, “My Lord has prohibited only the shameful acts,
whether open or secret, and (every) sinful act, and unjust aggression,
and that you associate with Allah anything for which He has not sent
any authority, and that you attribute to Allah any thing about which
you do not have sure knowledge.</item>
        <item>For every people there is an appointed time. So, when
their appointed time will come, they cannot be late for a moment, nor
will they get ahead.</item>
        <item>O children of ’Adam, if messengers from among you come
to you conveying My verses to you, then, those who fear Allah and
correct themselves will have no fear, nor shall they grieve.</item>
        <item>Those who reject Our verses and stand arrogant against
them, - they are the inmates of the Fire. There they shall live
forever.</item>
        <item>So, who is more unjust than the one who coins a lie
against Allah or rejects His signs? They shall receive their share
from that (sustenance) which is written (for them in their destiny)
until, when Our envoys (angels) shall come to them to take their souls
away, they (the angels) will say, “Where are those (so-called gods)
whom you used to invoke besides Allah?” They (the unbelievers) will
say, “They all have vanished from us”, and they shall testify against
themselves that they were unbelievers.</item>
        <item>He (Allah) will say, “Enter the Fire along with the
peoples who passed before you from the Jinn and the human beings.”
Whenever a group will enter it, they will curse their fellows, until
when all of them will have joined each other in it, the latter ones
will say about the former ones ¹²“Our Lord, they misguided us; so,
give them a double punishment of the Fire.” He will say, “For each
there is a double, ¹³but you do not know.”</item>
        <item>The former ones will say to the latter ones, “So, you
have no privilege against us. ¹⁴Now, taste the punishment for what you
have been earning.”</item>
        <item>Surely, those who have rejected Our signs and stood
arrogant against them, the gates of the heavens shall not be opened
for them, and they shall not enter Paradise unless a camel passes
through the eye of a needle. ¹⁵This is how We recompense the sinners.
</item>
        <item>For them there is a bed from the Jahannam, and over them
there are coverings. This is how We recompense the transgressors.
</item>
        <item>Those who believe and do good deeds,__We do not obligate
anyone beyond his capacity___they are the people of Paradise; they
shall remain there for ever.</item>
        <item>We will remove whatever amount of malice they had in
their hearts. Rivers will flow beneath them, and they will say, “All
praise is to Allah who has guided us to this. We would not have been
able to find the way, had Allah not guided us. Surely, the messengers
of our Lord came with the truth.” Then they will receive a call, “Here
is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit because of the
deeds you have been doing.”</item>
        <item>The inmates of Paradise will call out to the inmates of
the Fire: “We have found true what our Lord had promised to us. Have
you, too, found true what your Lord had promised?” They will say,
“Yes.” Then, an announcer between them will call out, “The curse of
Allah is on the wrongdoers</item>
        <item>Who used to turn themselves away from the way of Allah,
seeking to make it crooked, while they were the deniers of the
Hereafter.”</item>
        <item>Between the two groups there will be a barrier. And on
A‘raf (the Heights) there shall be people who will recognize each
group through their signs, ¹⁶and they will call out to the people of
Paradise, “Peace on you.” They will not have entered it, yet they will
hope to.</item>
        <item>When their eyes will be turned to the people of the
Fire, they will say, “Our Lord, do not join us with the unjust
people.”</item>
        <item>The people of A‘raf will call out to the people (of
Fire) whom they will recognize through their signs: “Your masses were
not of any help to you, nor was the arrogance you used to show.</item>
        <item>Is it these (people of Paradise) about whom you swore
that Allah would not allow His mercy to reach them?” (It will be said
to such people,) “Enter Paradise; ¹⁷there will be no fear for you, nor
shall you grieve.”</item>
        <item>The people of the Fire will call out to the people of
Paradise, “Pour on us some water, or some of what Allah has provided
you.” They will say, “Allah has prohibited these for disbelievers,
</item>
        <item>Who had taken their faith as play and a game, and the
worldly life had deceived them.” So, We shall forget them today, as
they had forgotten to face this day of theirs, and as they used to
deny Our signs.</item>
        <item>Surely We have brought them a book that We have
elaborated with knowledge, as guidance and mercy for a people who
believe.</item>
        <item>They are waiting for nothing but its final result (i.e.
the punishment promised in the Qur’an). The day when its final result
will come, those who had ignored it earlier will say, “Surely, the
messengers of our Lord had come with truth. So, are there any
intercessors for us who could intercede in our favor? Or, could we be
sent back, so that we might do contrary to what we used to do?”
Indeed, they have put their selves to loss, and vanished from them all
that they used to fabricate.</item>
        <item>Surely, your Lord is Allah who created the heavens and
the earth in six days, then He positioned himself on the Throne. He
covers the day with the night that pursues it swiftly. (He created)
the sun and the moon and the stars, subjugated to His command. Lo! To
Him alone belong the creation and the command ¹⁸. Glorious is Allah,
the Lord of all the worlds.</item>
        <item>Supplicate to your Lord humbly and secretly. Surely, He
does not like those who cross the limits.</item>
        <item>Do not make mischief on the earth after it has been set
in order. Supplicate Him in fear and hope. Surely, the mercy of Allah
is close to those who are good in their deeds.</item>
        <item>He is the One who sends the winds carrying good news
before His blessings ¹⁹, until when they lift up the heavy clouds, We
drive them to a dead land. Then, there We pour down water. Then, We
bring forth with it all sorts of fruits. In similar way, We will bring
forth all the dead. (All this is being explained to you), so that you
may learn a lesson.</item>
        <item>As for a good land, its vegetation comes out with the
permission of its Lord. But that which is bad does not grow except
what is bad. ²⁰Thus We alternate the verses in various ways for a
people who pay gratitude.</item>
        <item>Surely We sent Nuh ²¹to his people. So he said, “O my
people, worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. I fear for you
the punishment of a great Day.”</item>
        <item>The chiefs of his people said, “Indeed we see you in an
obvious error.”</item>
        <item>He said, “O my people, there is no error in me, but I am
a messenger from the Lord of all the worlds.</item>
        <item>I convey to you the messages of my Lord and wish your
betterment, and I know from Allah what you do not know.</item>
        <item>Do you wonder that an advice from your Lord has come to
you through a man from among you, so that he may warn you and that you
may fear Allah, and that you may be blessed with mercy?”</item>
        <item>Then, they accused him of falsehood; so We saved him,
and those with him in the Ark, and drowned those who rejected Our
signs. Certainly, they were a blind people.</item>
        <item>To ‘Ad, We sent their brother Hud. ²²He said, “O my
people, worship Allah; you have no god other than Him. So, will you
not fear Allah?”</item>
        <item>Said the chiefs of his people who disbelieved, “Indeed,
we see you in folly, and we believe you are one of the liars.”</item>
        <item>He said, “O my people, there is no folly in me, but I am
a messenger from the Lord of all the worlds.</item>
        <item>I convey to you the messages of my Lord; and I am an
honest well-wisher for you.</item>
        <item>Do you wonder that an advice from your Lord has come to
you through a man from among you, so that he may warn you? And
remember when He made you successors after the people of Nuh and gave
you increased strength in physique. ²³So, be mindful of the bounties
of Allah, so that you may be successful.”</item>
        <item>They said, “Have you come to us that we should worship
Allah alone and give up what our fathers used to worship? Now, bring
upon us that (scourge) with which you threaten us if you are one of
the truthful.”</item>
        <item>He said, “The punishment and the anger from your Lord
have fallen upon you. Do you quarrel with me about mere names that you
and your fathers have concocted and for which Allah has sent down no
authority? So, wait. I am one of those waiting with you.”</item>
        <item>So, We saved him and those with him out of mercy from
Us, and We eradicated those who rejected Our signs. They were not
believers.</item>
        <item>To Thamud, (We sent) their brother, Salih. ²⁴He said, “O
my people, worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. There has
come to you a clear sign from your Lord. This is the she-camel of
Allah, a sign for you. So, leave her to eat on the earth of Allah, and
do not touch her with mischief, lest a painful punishment should seize
you.</item>
        <item>Remember when He made you successors after ‘Ad and
lodged you on earth (whereby) you make castles in its plains and hew
out the mountains to build houses. So be mindful of the bounties of
Allah, and do not go about the earth spreading disorder.”</item>
        <item>The haughty chiefs of his people said to those of the
oppressed who had believed (in the Messenger), “Do you know for sure
that Salih is a messenger from his Lord?” They said, “Of course, we
believe in what he has been sent with.”</item>
        <item>The haughty people said, “As for us, we disbelieve in
what you believe.”</item>
        <item>Then they slaughtered the she-camel and defied the
command of their Lord and said, “O Salih, bring to us what you
threaten us with, if you are one of the messengers.”</item>
        <item>So, the earthquake seized them, and they were (found
dead) in their homes, fallen on their faces.</item>
        <item>So, he turned away from them and said, “O my people,
indeed I have delivered to you the message of my Lord, and wished you
betterment, but you do not like the well-wishers.”</item>
        <item>And (We sent) Lut (Lot) when he said to his people, “Do
you commit the shameful act in which nobody in the world has ever
preceded you? ²⁵</item>
        <item>You come to men lustfully instead of women. No, you are
a people who cross the limits.”</item>
        <item>The answer of his people was no other than to say,
“Expel them from your town. They are a people who pretend too much
purity.”</item>
        <item>So, We saved him and his family, except his wife. She
was one of those who remained behind. ²⁶</item>
        <item>And We rained down upon them a rain. So, look! How was
the fate of the sinners!</item>
        <item>And to Madyan (We sent) their brother Shu‘aib. ²⁷He said,
“O my people, worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. There has
come to you a clear sign from your Lord. Give the measure and weight
in full, and do not make people short of their things, and do not make
mischief on the earth after it has been set in order. That is good for
you, if you are believers.</item>
        <item>Do not sit in every path threatening and preventing from
the way of Allah the people who believe in Him, and seeking a twist in
it. Remember the time when you were few, then He increased you in
number. Consider the fate of those who used to make mischief.</item>
        <item>If a group from among you has believed in what I have
been sent with, and another group has not believed, then keep patience
until Allah decides between us. He is the best of all judges.”</item>
        <item>The chiefs of his people, who were arrogant, said, “O
Shu‘aib, we will expel you and those who believe with you from our
town, or you shall have to turn to our faith.” He said, “Even if we
hate it?</item>
        <item>We will be forging a lie against Allah, if we were to
turn to your faith after Allah has saved us from it. It is not for us
that we turn to it unless Allah, our Lord, so wills. Our Lord has
encompassed everything with His knowledge. In Allah we place our
trust. __Our Lord, decide between us and our people, with truth, and
You are the best of all judges.”</item>
        <item>The chiefs of his people who disbelieved said, “If you
are to follow Shu‘aib, then you will be utter losers.”</item>
        <item>So, the earthquake seized them, and they were (found
dead) in their homes, fallen on their faces.</item>
        <item>Those who rejected Shu‘aib became as if they never dwelt
there. Those who rejected Shu‘aib were themselves the losers.</item>
        <item>So, he turned away from them and said, “O my people, I
have surely delivered to you the message of my Lord, and wished your
betterment. How, then, should I grieve over a disbelieving
people?”</item>
        <item>We did not send any prophet to a town, but We seized its
people with hardship and suffering, so that they may turn humble.
</item>
        <item>Thereafter, We substituted good in place of evil until
they increased, and said, “Hardship and prosperity came to our fathers
(too).” Then We seized them suddenly while they were not aware.
²⁸</item>
        <item>If the people of the towns believed and feared Allah, We
would have opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth,
but they disbelieved. So, We seized them because of what they used to
earn for themselves.</item>
        <item>So, do the people of the towns feel themselves immune
from Our punishment that may befall them at night while they are
asleep?</item>
        <item>Or do the people of the towns feel themselves immune
from Our punishment that may befall them in broad daylight while they
are at play?</item>
        <item>Do they feel secure from Allah’s plan? None can feel
secure from Allah’s plan except the people who are losers.</item>
        <item>Have all these events still not taught a lesson to those
who inherit the land after its (former) inhabitants, that if We so
willed, We could afflict them for their sins? But We seal their
hearts, so that they do not listen.</item>
        <item>Those are the towns We narrate to you their important
events. Surely their messengers came to them with clear signs, but
they were not able to believe in what they had rejected earlier. This
is how Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers.</item>
        <item>We did not find with most of them any covenant
(unbroken), and surely We have found most of them sinners.</item>
        <item>After them, We sent Musa with Our signs to Pharaoh and
his chiefs. ²⁹But they did injustice to them. So, consider the fate of
the mischief-makers.</item>
        <item>Musa said, “O Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Lord of
all the worlds;</item>
        <item>It befits me not to say anything about Allah except the
truth. I have come to you with a clear sign from your Lord. So, let
the children of Isra’il go with me.”</item>
        <item>He said, “If you have come with a sign, then bring it
forth, if you are really truthful.”</item>
        <item>So he threw down his staff, and in no time it was a
vivid serpent;</item>
        <item>And he drew out his hand, and it was luminous for the
onlookers.</item>
        <item>The chiefs of the people of Pharaoh said, “This man is
certainly a sorcerer of great knowledge.</item>
        <item>He wants to expel you from your land. So, what do you
suggest?”</item>
        <item>They said, “leave him and his brother alone for a while,
and send (your) men to the cities to collect</item>
        <item>And bring to you every expert sorcerer (who could defeat
him).”</item>
        <item>The sorcerers came to Pharaoh. They said, “There must be
a reward for us, if we are the victors.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Yes, and of course, you will be among the
closer ones (to me).”</item>
        <item>They said, “O Musa, would you throw (first) or are we to
throw?”</item>
        <item>He said, “You throw.” So when they threw, they bewitched
the eyes of the people, and made them frightened, and produced great
sorcery.</item>
        <item>We revealed to Musa, “Throw your staff.” Then of a
sudden, it began to swallow all that they had concocted.</item>
        <item>Thus the truth prevailed, and what they were doing
became a nullity.</item>
        <item>So, they were overcome then and there and turned
humiliated.</item>
        <item>The sorcerers could not but fall in prostration.
³⁰</item>
        <item>They said, “We believe in the Lord of the worlds,</item>
        <item>The Lord of Musa and Harun.”</item>
        <item>Pharaoh said, “You have believed in him before my
permission. Undoubtedly, this is a plot you have designed in the city,
so that you may expel its people from it. Now you shall know (its
end).</item>
        <item>I will cut off your hands and your legs from opposite
sides. Then I will crucify you all together.”</item>
        <item>They said, “We have surely to return to our Lord.</item>
        <item>For what fault would you punish us except that we have
believed in the signs of our Lord when they appeared to us? O our
Lord, pour out patience upon us, and cause us to die as Muslims (those
who submit to you.)”</item>
        <item>The chiefs of the people of Pharaoh said, “Shall you
leave Musa and his people free to spread disorder in the land and to
abandon you and your gods?” He said, “We shall slaughter their sons
and let their women remain alive. We have full power over
them.”</item>
        <item>Musa said to his people, “Seek help from Allah and be
patient. Surely, the land belongs to Allah. He lets whomsoever He
wills inherit it from among His servants; and the end-result is in
favor of the God-fearing.”</item>
        <item>They said, “We were persecuted before you came to us and
after you have come to us.” He said, “Hopefully your Lord will destroy
your enemy and make you successors in the land, then He will see how
you act.”</item>
        <item>And We seized the people of Pharaoh with years of famine
and poor production of fruits, so that they may learn a lesson.</item>
        <item>When good times came to them, they said, “This is our
right.” And if an evil touched them, they took it as an ill omen of
Musa and those with him. Listen, their ill omen lies with Allah only,
but most of them do not know.</item>
        <item>They said, “Whatever sign you bring to us to enchant us
with, we are not going to believe in you.”</item>
        <item>So We sent upon them the storm and locusts and lice and
frogs and blood, as signs distinct from each other. ³¹Yet they showed
arrogance, and they were a guilty people.</item>
        <item>Whenever a scourge befell them, they said, “O Musa, pray
for us to your Lord by the covenant He has made with you. If you
remove the scourge from us, we will truly believe in you, and will
send the children of Isra’il with you.”</item>
        <item>But when We removed the scourge from them for a term
they had to reach, in no time they started to break their promise.
</item>
        <item>Then We subjected them to retribution, and drowned them
in the sea, because they rejected Our signs, and were neglectful of
them.</item>
        <item>We caused those people who were deemed to be weak (the
Israelites) to inherit the East and West of the land that We had
blessed. And the sublime word of your Lord was fulfilled for the
children of Isra’il, because they stood patient; and We destroyed what
Pharaoh and his people used to build and what they used to raise high.
</item>
        <item>We made the children of Isra’il cross the sea, then they
came across a people sitting in devotion before their idols. They (the
Israelites) said, “O Musa, make a god for us like they have gods.” He
said, “You are really an ignorant people.</item>
        <item>What these people are engaged in is sure to be
destroyed; and false is what they are doing.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Shall I seek any one other than Allah as God
for you, while He has given you excellence over the (people of all
the) worlds.”</item>
        <item>Remember) when We delivered you from the people of
Pharaoh who inflicted grievous torment upon you, slaughtered your sons
and left your women alive. In all that there was a great trial from
your Lord.</item>
        <item>And We made an appointment with Musa for thirty nights,
then We supplemented them with another ten. So, the total period fixed
by his Lord was forty nights. ³²Musa said to his brother Harun, “Take
my place among my people and keep things right, and do not follow the
way of mischief makers.”</item>
        <item>When Musa came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke
to him, he said, “My Lord, show (Yourself) to me that I may look at
You.” He said: “You shall never see Me. But look at the mount. If it
stays at its place, you will see Me.” So when his Lord appeared to the
Mount, He made it smashed, and Musa fell down unconscious. When he
recovered, he said: “Pure are You. I repent to You, and I am the first
to believe (that no one can see You in this world.)”</item>
        <item>He said, “Musa, I have chosen you above all men for my
messages and for My speaking (to you). So, take what I have given to
you, and be among the grateful.”</item>
        <item>We wrote for him on the Tablets advice of every kind,
and explanations of all (needful) things. “So hold it firm, and ask
your people to hold on to the best things in it. I shall show you the
house of the sinners. ³³</item>
        <item>I shall keep away from My verses those who show
arrogance on the earth with no right to do so. Even if they were to
see every sign, they would not believe in it; and if they see the Path
of guidance, they do not take it as their way; and if they see the
path of misguidance, they would take it as their way. That is because
they have rejected Our signs, and have been neglectful of them.</item>
        <item>Gone to waste are the deeds of those who have rejected
Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter. They will be recompensed
only for what they have been doing.</item>
        <item>And in the absence of Musa, his people made a calf from
their ornaments, which was merely a sculpture with a moaning sound.
³⁴Did they not see that it neither talked to them nor could it guide
them to any way? They adopted it (as god), and were so unjust.</item>
        <item>When they became remorseful and saw that they had gone
astray, they said, “If Allah shows no mercy to us, and does not
forgive us, we shall certainly be among the losers.”</item>
        <item>When Musa returned to his people, angry and sad, he
said, “How bad is the thing you have done in my absence! How did you
act in haste against the command of your Lord?” He dropped down the
Tablets, and grabbed the head of his brother, pulling him towards
himself. He (Harun) said, “My mother’s son, the people took me as weak
and were about to kill me. So do not let the enemies laugh at me, and
do not count me with the wrong-doers.”</item>
        <item>He said, “My Lord! Forgive me and my brother, and admit
us into Your mercy. You are the most Merciful of all the
merciful.”</item>
        <item>Surely, those who have taken the calf (as god) shall be
seized by Allah’s wrath and by humiliation in the worldly life. That
is how we recompense the fabricators.</item>
        <item>As for those who do evil, and repent thereafter, and
embrace faith, your Lord is then most forgiving, very merciful (for
them).</item>
        <item>When the fury of Musa calmed down, he picked up the
Tablets, and in its contents there was guidance, and mercy for those
who are fearful before their Lord.</item>
        <item>And Musa selected seventy men from his people for Our
appointment. ³⁵Later when the earthquake seized them, he said, “My
Lord, had it been Your will, You could have destroyed them earlier,
and me too. Would You destroy us for what the foolish among us have
done? It is nothing but a trial from You, wherewith you let go astray
whom You will, and give guidance to whom You will. You are our
protector, so forgive us, andhave mercy on us, and You are the best
among those who forgive.</item>
        <item>And write for us good in this world and in the
Hereafter. We turn to You in repentance.” He (Allah) said, “As for My
punishment, I afflict with it whom I will. And My mercy extends to
everything. ³⁶So, I shall write itfor those who guard themselves
against evil, and pay Zakah, and those who do believe in Our verses,
</item>
        <item>Those who follow the Messenger, the Ummiyy (unlettered)
prophet ³⁷whom they find written with them in the Torah and the Injil ,
³⁸and who bids them what is fair and forbids what is unfair, and makes
lawful for them good things, and makes unlawful for them impure
things, and relieves them of their burden, and of the shackles that
were upon them. ³⁹So, those who believe in him and support him, and
help him and follow the light sent down with him,</item>
        <item>O Prophet Muhammad) Say, “O people, I am a messenger of
Allah (sent) to you from the One to whom belongs the kingdom of the
heavens and the earth. There is no god but He. He gives life and
brings death. So, believe in Allah and His Messenger, the Ummiyy
(unlettered) prophet, who believes in Allah and in His words, and
follow him, so that you may find the right path.” ⁴⁰</item>
        <item>Among the community of Musa there are people who guide
with truth and do justice thereby. ⁴¹</item>
        <item>And We divided them into twelve tribes, as separate
communities, and We revealed to Musa when his people asked him for
water, ⁴²“Strike the rock with your staff.” Then twelve springs gushed
forth from it. Each tribe came to know their drinking place. We shaded
them with the shadow of the clouds. And We sent down to them Mann and
Salwa (saying), “Eat of the good things we have provided you.” And
they did us no harm, rather they have been harming their own selves.
</item>
        <item>Recall) when it was said to them, “Live in this town and
eat therefrom anywhere you like, and say, Hittah (we seek forgiveness)
and enter the gate prostrating yourselves, so that We forgive your
errors. We shall give much more to those who are good in their
deeds.”</item>
        <item>But those of them who were unjust substituted another
word for the one that was said to them. So, We sent down upon them a
scourge from the heavens, because they had been transgressing.</item>
        <item>Ask them about the town situated by the sea, when they
used to transgress in the matter of Sabbath, ⁴³hen their fish came to
them openly on their Sabbath, and did not come to them when they did
not have Sabbath. In this way, We put them to a test, because they
used toact sinfully.</item>
        <item>When a group of them said, “Why do you exhort a people
whom Allah is going to destroy or chastise with a severe punishment?”
They said, “To absolve ourselves before your Lord, and in order that
they may fear Allah.” ⁴⁴</item>
        <item>So, when they forgot the advice they were given, We
saved those who used to forbid evil and seized those who transgressed
with a bitter punishment, because they had been disobeying.</item>
        <item>When they persisted in doing what they were forbidden
from, We said to them, “Become apes debased.” ⁴⁵</item>
        <item>Recall) when your Lord declared that He would surely
keep sending to them, till the Day of Judgment, those who inflict on
them evil chastisement. ⁴⁶ertainly, your Lord is swift in punishing,
and certainly He is the Most-forgiving, Very Merciful.</item>
        <item>We divided them on the earth as separate communities.
Some of them were righteous, while some others were otherwise. We
tested them with good and bad times, so that they might return.</item>
        <item>Then, after them, came a generation that inherited the
Book, opting for the mundane stuff of this world and saying, “We shall
be forgiven.” But if there comes to them similar stuff, they would opt
for it (again). ⁴⁷Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that
they should not say anything but the truth about Allah? They learnt
what it contained. Certainly, the Last Abode is better for those who
fear Allah. Have you then, no sense?</item>
        <item>Those who hold fast to the Book and establish Salah, We
shall never let the reward of (such) righteous people to go to waste.
</item>
        <item>When We raised the mountain over them as though it were
a canopy, and they thought it was falling upon them, (We said,)
“Adhere firmly to what We have given you and remember what is therein,
so that you may become God-fearing.” ⁴⁸</item>
        <item>Recall) when your Lord brought forth their progeny from
the loins of the children of ’Adam, and made them testify about
themselves (by asking them,) “Am I not your Lord?” They said, “Of
course, You are. We testify.” ⁴⁹(We did so) lest you should say on the
Day of Judgment, “We were unaware of this,”</item>
        <item>Or you should say, “It was our forefathers who
associated partners with Allah, and we were their progeny after them;
would you then destroy us on account of what the erroneous
did?”</item>
        <item>This is how We elaborate the verses, so that they may
return.</item>
        <item>Recite to them the story of the one whom We gave Our
verses, then he wriggled out from them, so Satan pursued him and he
became one of the perverted.</item>
        <item>If We so willed, We would have elevated him thereby; but
he clung to the earth and followed his desires. ⁵⁰So, his example is
like the example of a dog, if you attack him, he pants with his tongue
protruding, and if you leave him alone he still pants with his tongue
protruding. ⁵¹That is the example of those who rejected Our signs. So,
relate the chronicles, so that they may ponder.</item>
        <item>Evil is the example of those who have rejected Our signs
and have been doing wrong to themselves.</item>
        <item>The one whom Allah gives guidance is the one on the
right path. As for those whom Allah lets go astray, those are the
losers.</item>
        <item>Surely We have created for Hell a lot of people from
among Jinn and mankind. They have hearts wherewith they do not
understand, eyes wherewith they do not see, and ears wherewith they do
not hear. They are like cattle. Rather, they are much more astray.
They are the heedless.</item>
        <item>For Allah there are the most beautiful names. So, call
Him by them, and leave those who deviate in (the matter of) His names.
⁵²They shall be recompensed for what they have been doing.</item>
        <item>Among those whom We have created there are people who
guide with truth and do justice thereby.</item>
        <item>As for those who reject Our signs, We will lead them
gradually (towards their punishment) in a way that they do not know.
</item>
        <item>I give them respite. Surely My plan is firm.</item>
        <item>Have they not reflected that their fellow (i.e. the Holy
Prophet (S.A.W)) does not suffer from any madness? He is but a plain
warner.</item>
        <item>Have they not looked into the kingdom of the heavens and
the earth, and into the things Allah has created, and into the fact
that their time might have possibly drawn near? In which other
discourse, then, shall they believe after this?</item>
        <item>For those whom Allah lets go astray, there is no one to
guide, and He leaves them wandering blindly in their rebellion.</item>
        <item>They ask you about the Hour (i.e. the Doomsday), “When
is it due to happen?” Say, “Its knowledge is only with my Lord. No one
can unfold it except He at its time. It shall weigh heavy in the
heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you but suddenly.” They
ask you as if you were aware of it. Say, “Its knowledge is only with
Allah, but most of the people do not know.”</item>
        <item>Say, “I have no power to bring a benefit or a harm to
myself, except that which Allah wills. If I had the knowledge of the
Unseen, I would have accumulated a lot of good things, and no evil
would have ever touched me. I am but a warner, and a herald of good
news for a people who believe.”</item>
        <item>He is the One who has created you from a single soul,
and out of him created his wife, so that he may find comfort in her.
So when he covers her with himself, she carries a light burden and
moves about with it. Thereafter, when she grows heavy, they both pray
to Allah, their Lord, “If You bless us with a perfect child, we shall
be grateful.”</item>
        <item>But when We bless them with a perfect child, they
ascribe partners to Him in what He blessed them with. ⁵³Indeed Allah is
much higher than what they associate with Him.</item>
        <item>Do they associate those with Allah who do not create any
thing, rather, they are created (themselves)?</item>
        <item>And they (the alleged partners) cannot extend to them
any help, nor can they help themselves.</item>
        <item>If you call them to the right path, they will not follow
you. It is all the same for them whether you call them or remain
silent.</item>
        <item>Surely, those whom you invoke beside Allah are slaves
(of Allah) like you. So, call them, and they should respond to you if
you are true.</item>
        <item>Do they have legs to walk with? Or do they have hands to
grasp with? Or do they have eyes to see with or do they have ears to
hear with? Say, “Call to your associate-gods, then, plot against me
and allow me no respite.</item>
        <item>Surely, my protector is Allah who has revealed the Book
and who does protect the righteous.”</item>
        <item>Those whom you call beside Him cannot help you, nor can
they help themselves.</item>
        <item>If you call them for guidance, they shall not hear. You
see them as if they are looking at you, while they cannot see.</item>
        <item>O Prophet,) take forgiveness (as your habit), enjoin
virtue, and ignore the ignorant.</item>
        <item>Should a stroke from the Satan strike you, seek refuge
with Allah. Surely, He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Surely when the God-fearing are touched by any
instigation from Satan, they become conscious (of Allah), and at once
they discern (the reality).</item>
        <item>As for the brethren of satans, they are dragged by them
on into the error, and they do not desist. ⁵⁴</item>
        <item>When you do not bring them a sign, they say, “Could you
not make up one?” ⁵⁵Say, “I only follow what is revealed to me from my
Lord.” This is (a Book of) insights from your Lord and a guidance and
mercy for a people who believe.</item>
        <item>When the Qur’an is recited, listen to it and be silent,
so that you may be blessed.</item>
        <item>Remember your Lord in your heart with humility and awe,
and without speaking loudly, in mornings and evenings, and do not be
among the heedless.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who are with your Lord (i.e. the angels)
are not arrogant against His worship, and they proclaim His purity,
and before Him they prostrate themselves. ⁵⁶</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>They ask you about the spoils. Say, “The spoils are for
Allah and the Messenger.” So, fear Allah, and set your relations
right, and obey Allah and His Messenger, if you are believers.
¹</item>
        <item>Certainly, the believers are those whose hearts are
filled with awe when (the name of) Allah is mentioned; and when His
verses are recited to them, it makes them more developed in faith; and
in their Lord they place their trust.</item>
        <item>They are) those who establish Salah, and give away from
what We have given to them.</item>
        <item>Those are the believers in reality. For them there are
high ranks with their Lord, and forgiveness, and dignified provision.
</item>
        <item>It is like when your Lord made you leave your home for
the sake of truth, ²while a group from the believers were averse to
it; ³</item>
        <item>They were disputing with you about the truth after it
became clear, as if they were being driven to death being seen by
them.</item>
        <item>And recall when Allah was promising you that one of the
two groups would become yours, and you were wishing that the one
without strength should fall to you. And Allah wanted to establish the
truth through His words and to cut off the very root of the
disbelievers, ⁴</item>
        <item>So that He proves the truth to be true and the falsehood
to be false, even though the sinners might dislike it.</item>
        <item>When you were calling your Lord for help, so He
responded to you (saying): “I am going to support you with one
thousand of the angels, one following the other.”</item>
        <item>And Allah has made it (the promise) merely to give you a
good news, and so that your hearts might be at rest thereby. And the
help is from none but Allah. Surely, Allah is Mighty, Wise.</item>
        <item>When He covered you with drowsiness, as tranquility
(descending) from Him ⁵and sent down upon you water from the heavens,
so that He might purify you with it, and remove from you the impurity
of Satan, and so that He might strengthen your hearts and make (your)
feet firm therewith. ⁶</item>
        <item>When your Lord revealed to the angels: “I am with you.
So, make firm the feet of those who believe. I shall cast awe into the
hearts of those who disbelieve. So, strike at the necks, and strike at
every finger-joint of theirs.”</item>
        <item>That is because they were hostile to Allah and His
Messenger; and whoever becomes hostile to Allah and His Messenger,
then, Allah is severe at punishment.</item>
        <item>That is what you have to taste, and for the disbelievers
is the (further) punishment of the Fire.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, when you face the disbelievers in a
battle, do not turn your backs to them.</item>
        <item>Whoever turns his back to them on such a day,__ unless
it is for a tactic in the battle, or to join a company,__turns with
wrath from Allah, and his abode is Jahannam (Hell), and it is an evil
place to return.</item>
        <item>So, it is not you who killed them, but in fact Allah
killed them. And you did not throw when you threw but Allah did throw,
⁷so that He might bless the believers with a good favour. Surely, Allah
is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Apart from that, Allah is the One who frustrates the
device of the disbelievers.</item>
        <item>O unbelievers,) if you were looking for a decision, the
‘decision’ has come upon you. And if you give up, it is better for
you. And if you repeat, We shall repeat. And your people shall not
suffice you at all, even though they are many in number; and Allah is
with the believers.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, obey Allah and His Messenger, and do
not turn away from Him when you listen (to him).</item>
        <item>And do not be like those who say, “We have listened”
while they do not listen ⁸.</item>
        <item>Surely, the worst of all animals in the sight of Allah
are the deaf and the dumb who do not understand.</item>
        <item>Had Allah seen in them some good, He would have made
them listen (as due). But if He makes them listen (now), they will
turn away paying no heed.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, respond to Allah and the Messenger
when He calls you to what gives you life, and be sure that Allah
intervenes between man and his heart, and that to Him you shall be
gathered.</item>
        <item>And beware of a scourge that shall not fall only on the
wrongdoers from among you, ⁹and know well that Allah is severe at
punishment.</item>
        <item>Recall when you were few in number, oppressed on the
earth, fearing that the people would snatch you away. Then, He gave
you shelter and fortified you with His support and provided you with
good things, so that you may be grateful.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not betray the trust of Allah and
the Messenger__, and do not betray your mutual trusts, while you know.
</item>
        <item>Be aware that your wealth and your children are but a
trial and that with Allah there is a great reward.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, if you fear Allah, He will provide
you with a criterion (to distinguish between right and wrong) and will
write off your evil deeds and will forgive you. Allah is the Lord of
great bounty.</item>
        <item>And (recall) when the disbelievers were conspiring
against you to hold you as a captive, or to kill you, or to expel you.
¹⁰They were planning, and Allah was planning, and Allah is the best
planner.</item>
        <item>When Our verses are recited to them, they say, “We have
heard; if we wish, we can compose a discourse like this. It is nothing
but the tales of the ancient people.” ¹¹</item>
        <item>And (recall) when they said, “O Allah, if this is indeed
the truth (revealed) from You, then, rain down stones upon us from the
heavens, or bring upon us a painful punishment.”</item>
        <item>And Allah was not to send scourge upon them while you (O
Prophet), were in their midst, nor would Allah send scourge upon them
while they are seeking forgiveness.</item>
        <item>And what privilege do they have that Allah should not
punish them, while they prevent (people) from Al-Masjid-ul-Haram (the
Sacred Mosque), even though they are not (competent to be) its
custodians? Its (competent) custodians are none but the God-fearing,
but most of them do not know.</item>
        <item>And their prayer near the House was not more than
whistling and clapping. So, taste the punishment, because you used to
disbelieve.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who disbelieve spend their wealth to
prevent (people) from the way of Allah. ¹²So, they shall spend it,
then it will become remorse for them, then they shall be overpowered,
and those who disbelieve shall be gathered into Jahannam ,</item>
        <item>So that Allah may separate the wicked from the good
people, and join the wicked with each other, and heaps them all
together, and puts them into Jahannam . Those are the losers.</item>
        <item>Say to those who disbelieve that if they desist (from
infidelity), they shall be forgiven for what has passed (of their
sins), and if they repeat, then, the precedent of the earlier people
is already established (that the infidels are punished).</item>
        <item>And fight them until there is no Fitnah (mischief), and
total obedience becomes for Allah. So, if they desist, then, Allah is
indeed watchful over what they do.</item>
        <item>And if they turn away, then, rest assured that Allah is
your protector. So excellent a protector is He, and so excellent a
supporter.</item>
        <item>And know that whatever spoils you receive, its one fifth
is for Allah and for His Messenger, and for kinsmen and orphans and
the needy and the wayfarer, if you do believe in Allah and in what We
have sent down upon Our Servant on the decisive day ¹³, the day when
the two forces encountered each other. And Allah is powerful over
everything.</item>
        <item>Remember) when you were on the nearest end of the
valley, and they were on the farthest one, and the caravan was
downwards from you. ¹⁴ Had you made an appointment with each other, you
would have disagreed about the appointment. But (it happened like
this) so that Allah might accomplish what was destined to be done, so
that whoever is going to perish may perish knowingly, and whoever is
going to live may live knowingly. ¹⁵ Allah is indeed All-Hearing, AllKnowing.</item>
        <item>Recall) when in your dream, Allah showed them to you few
in number. And if He had shown them to you many in number, you would
have been demoralized and would have disputed in the matter, but Allah
saved (you). Surely, Allah is fully aware of what lies in the hearts.
</item>
        <item>And when, at the time you met each other, He showed them
to you few in number in your eyes, and reduced your number in their
eyes, so that Allah might accomplish what was destined to be done. And
to Allah all matters are returned.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, when you face a group (in battle),
stand firm and remember Allah abundantly, so that you may be
successful.</item>
        <item>Obey Allah and His Messenger, and do not quarrel with
each other, lest you should lose courage, and your prowess should
evaporate; and be patient. Surely, Allah is with the patient.</item>
        <item>And do not be like those who set forth from their homes
waxing proud and showing off to people, preventing (people) from the
way of Allah. Allah is All-Encompassing of what they do.</item>
        <item>When the Satan made their deeds look beautiful to their
eyes, and said, “None of the people can overpower you today, and I am
a protector for you.” But, when the two groups faced each other, he
turned back on his heels and said, “I am quit of you. I am seeing what
you do not see. I am scared of Allah, and Allah is severe in
punishment.” ¹⁶</item>
        <item>When the hypocrites and those who have a malady in their
hearts said, “The belief of these people has deluded them.” ¹⁷And
whoever places his trust in Allah (becomes victorious, because) Allah
is Mighty, Wise.</item>
        <item>Only if you were to see (them) when the angels take out
the souls of those who disbelieve, beating their faces and their
backs, and (saying) “Taste the punishment of the flaming Fire.</item>
        <item>That is due to what your hands sent ahead, and that
Allah is not cruel to (His) servants.”</item>
        <item>Their way is) like the way of the people of Pharaoh and
of those before them. They rejected the signs of Allah; so Allah
seized them for their sins. Surely, Allah is strong, severe in
punishment.</item>
        <item>All this is because Allah is not the one who may change
a favour He has conferred on a people unless they change their own
condition, and that Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Their practice is like that of the people of Pharaoh and
those before them. They rejected the signs of their Lord. So, We
destroyed them for their sins and drowned the people of Pharaoh; and
all of them were wrongdoers.</item>
        <item>Surely, the worst of all the moving creatures, in the
sight of Allah, are those who reject Faith and do not believe</item>
        <item>Those with whom you have entered into a treaty, then
they break their treaty each time, and they do not fear Allah.
¹⁸</item>
        <item>So, if you find them in war, deal with them in a way
that those behind them have to disperse fearfully, so that they take a
lesson.</item>
        <item>And if you apprehend a breach from a people, then, throw
(the treaty) towards them in straight-forward terms. ¹⁹Surely, Allah
does not like those who breach the trust.</item>
        <item>The disbelievers should never think that they have
surpassed (the divine punishment). Surely, they cannot frustrate (the
Divine will).</item>
        <item>Prepare against them whatever force you can, and the
trained horses whereby you frighten Allah’s enemy and your own enemy
and others besides them whom you do not know. Allah knows them.
Whatever thing you spend in the way of Allah, it will be paid to you
in full, and you shall not be wronged.</item>
        <item>And if they tilt towards peace, you too should tilt
towards it, and place your trust in Allah. Surely, He is the AllHearing, the All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>If they intend to deceive you, then, Allah is allsufficient for you. He is the One who supported you with His help and
with the believers,</item>
        <item>And united their hearts. Had you spent all that is on
earth, you could not have united their hearts. But Allah did unite
their hearts. Surely, He is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>O Prophet, Allah is sufficient for you, and the
believers who followed you.</item>
        <item>O Prophet, rouse the believers to fighting. If there are
twenty among you, who are patient, they will overcome two hundred; and
if there are one hundred among you, they will overcome one thousand of
those who disbelieve, because they are a people who do not understand.
²⁰</item>
        <item>Now Allah has lightened your burden, and He knew that
there is weakness in you. So, if there are one hundred among you, who
are patient, they will overcome two hundred; and if there are one
thousand among you, they will overcome two thousand by the will of
Allah. ²¹Allah is with the patient.</item>
        <item>It is not befitting a prophet that he has captives with
him unless he has subdued the enemy by shedding blood in the land.
²²You intend to have the stuff of this world, while Allah intends the
Hereafter (for you). And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>Had there not been a decree from Allah that came
earlier, a great punishment would have overtaken you because of what
you have taken. ²³</item>
        <item>So, eat of the spoils you have got, ²⁴lawful and pure,
and fear Allah. Surely, Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>O Prophet, say to the prisoners in your hands, “If Allah
knows any goodness in your hearts, ²⁵He will give you something better
than what has been taken from you, and will forgive you. Allah is
Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.”</item>
        <item>And if they intend to commit treachery against you,
then, they have already committed treachery against Allah, and in turn
Allah has given you full control over them. ²⁶And Allah is All-Knowing,
Wise.</item>
        <item>Surely those who believed and emigrated and carried out
Jihad in the way of Allah with their wealth and lives, and those who
gave refuge and help (to the emigrants), both are close friends to
each other. ²⁷ And those who believed and did not emigrate, you have no
friendship with them at all, unless they emigrate. However, if they
seek your help in the matter of faith, then, you are bound to help,
except against a people with whom you have a treaty. Allah is watchful
over what you</item>
        <item>And those who disbelieve are friends to each other. If
you do not do so, there shall be disorder on the earth, and a great
corruption.</item>
        <item>Those who have believed and emigrated and carried out
Jihad in the way of Allah, and those who gave refuge and help, both
are the believers in truth. For them there is forgiveness and a
respectful provision.</item>
        <item>Those who believed later on and emigrated and carried
out Jihad alongwith you, then, they are joined with you. As for the
womb-relatives, they are closer to one another according to the Book
of Allah. ²⁸Surely, Allah is aware of every thing.</item>
        <item>Here is a disavowal (proclaimed) by Allah and His
Messenger against the Mushriks (polytheists) with whom you have a
treaty. ¹</item>
        <item>So, move in the land freely for four months, and be
aware that you can never frustrate Allah, and that Allah is going to
disgrace the disbelievers.</item>
        <item>And here is an announcement, from Allah and His
Messenger, to the people on the day of the greater Hajj, ²that Allah
is free from (any commitment to) the Mushriks, and so is His
Messenger. Now, if you repent, it is good for you. And if you turn
away, then be aware that you can never frustrate Allah. And give those
who disbelieve the ‘good’ news of a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>Except those of the Mushriks with whom you have a
treaty, and they were not deficient (in fulfilling the treaty) with
you, and did not back up any one against you. So fulfill the treaty
with them up to their term. Surely, Allah loves the God-fearing.
</item>
        <item>So, when the sacred months expire, kill the Mushriks
wherever you find them, and catch them and besiege them and sit in
ambush for them everywhere. Then, if they repent and establish Salah
and pay Zakah, leave their way. Surely, Allah is most Forgiving, VeryMerciful.</item>
        <item>And if any one of the Mushriks seeks your protection,
give him protection until he listens to the Word of Allah, then let
him reach his place of safety. ³That is because they are a people who
do not know.</item>
        <item>How can the Mushriks have a treaty with Allah and His
Messenger? Except those with whom you made a treaty near Al-Masjid-ulHaram . Then, as long as they remain straight with you, you too remain
straight with them. Surely, Allah loves the God-fearing.</item>
        <item>How (can they have a treaty) while if they overcome you,
they will not observe any bond or treaty with you. They want to please
you with (words of) their mouths, but their hearts refuse. Most of
them are sinners.</item>
        <item>They have taken a paltry price for the verses of Allah,
so they have prevented (people) from His path. Indeed, evil is what
they have been doing.</item>
        <item>They do not observe any bond or treaty with a believer;
and they are the transgressors.</item>
        <item>Then, if they repent and establish Salah and pay Zakah,
they are your brothers in faith. We elaborate the verses for a people
who understand.</item>
        <item>And if they break their oaths after they have made a
covenant, and speak evil of your Faith, then fight the leaders of
infidelity,__since their oaths are nothing,___so that they may desist,
</item>
        <item>Would you not fight a people who broke their oaths and
conspired to expel the Messenger, and it was they who started
(fighting) against you for the first time? Do you fear them? But Allah
has greater right that you fear Him, if you are believers.</item>
        <item>Fight them, so that Allah should punish them at your
hands and disgrace them, and help you win against them and bring
relief to bosoms of the believing people,</item>
        <item>And remove the rage of their hearts. And Allah relents
to whomsoever He wills. Allah is (All-) Knowing, (All-) Wise.</item>
        <item>Do you think that you will be left alone (without being
tested), while Allah has not yet seen those of you who struggle in
Jihad and never take anyone as their confidant other than Allah and
His Messenger and the believers? Allah is fully aware of what you do.
</item>
        <item>It is not for the Mushriks to build up the mosques of
Allah while they are witnesses of their own infidelity. Those are the
ones whose deeds have gone to waste; and in the Fire they shall remain
forever.</item>
        <item>In fact, the mosques of Allah are built-up only by those
who believe in Allah and the Last Day and those who establish Salah
and pay Zakah and who fear none but Allah. ⁴So, it is hoped that they
are to be among those on the right path.</item>
        <item>Have you taken the serving of water to the pilgrims and
the maintenance of Al-Masjid-ul-Haram as equal to (the acts) of one
who believes in Allah and in the Last Day, and carries out Jihad in
the way of Allah? They are not equal in the sight of Allah. Allah does
not lead the wrongdoing people to the right path.</item>
        <item>Those who believed and emigrated and carried out Jihad
in the way of Allah with their wealth and lives are greater in rank in
the sight of Allah, and it is they who are the successful.</item>
        <item>Their Lord gives them the happy news of Mercy from Him,
and of (His) Pleasure, and of Gardens having an everlasting bliss for
them,</item>
        <item>Where they shall dwell forever. Surely, it is Allah with
whom lies a great reward.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not take your fathers and your
brothers as your friends, if they prefer infidelity to Faith. Those of
you who have friendship with them are the wrongdoers.</item>
        <item>Say, “If your fathers and your sons and your brothers
and your spouses and your clan and the wealth you have earned and the
trade you apprehend will recede and the homes you like are dearer to
you than Allah and His Messenger and Jihad in His way, then, wait
until Allah comes with His command. Allah does not lead the sinning
people to the right path.”</item>
        <item>Allah has surely blessed you with His help on many
battlefields, and on the day of Hunain, ⁵when you were proud of your
great number, then it did not help you at all, and the earth was
straitened for you despite all its vastness, then you turned back on
your heels.</item>
        <item>Then Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger
and upon the believers, and sent down troops that you did not see, and
punished those who disbelieved. That is the recompense of the
disbelievers.</item>
        <item>Yet Allah relents, after that, to whomsoever He wills.
Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, the Mushriks are impure indeed, so
let them not approach Al-Masjid-ul-Haram after this year. ⁶And if you
apprehend poverty, then, Allah shall, if He wills, make you selfsufficient with His grace. ⁷Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
</item>
        <item>Fight those People of the Book who do not believe in
Allah, nor in the Last Day, ⁸and do not take as unlawful what Allah and
His Messenger have declared as unlawful, and do not profess the Faith
of Truth; (fight them) until they pay jizyah with their own hands
while they are subdued. ⁹</item>
        <item>The Jews say, “ ‘Uzair (Ezra) is the Son of Allah” ¹⁰and
the Christians say, “Masih (the Christ) is the Son of Allah.” That is
their oral statement. They imitate the saying of the earlier
disbelievers. May Allah ruin them, how far they are turned back from
the truth!</item>
        <item>They have taken their rabbis and their monks as gods
beside Allah, ¹¹and also (they have taken) Masih the son of Maryam (as
god). And they were not commanded but to worship only One God. There
is no god but He. Pure is He from what they associate with Him.</item>
        <item>They wish to blow out the Light of Allah with their
mouths, and Allah rejects everything short of making His light
perfect, no matter how the disbelievers may hate it.</item>
        <item>He is the One who has sent down His Messenger with
guidance and the Faith of Truth, so that He makes it prevail over
every faith, no matter how the Mushriks may hate it.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, many of the rabbis and the monks do
eat up the wealth of the people by false means and prevent (them) from
the way of Allah. As for those who accumulate gold and silver and do
not spend it in the way of Allah, give them the ‘good’ news of a
painful punishment,</item>
        <item>On the day it (the wealth) will be heated up in the fire
of Jahannam, then their foreheads and their sides and their backs
shall be branded with it: “This is what you had accumulated for
yourselves. So, taste what you have been accumulating.”</item>
        <item>Surely, the number of months according to Allah is
twelve (as written) in the Book of Allah on the day He created the
heavens and the Earth, of which there are Four Sacred Months. That is
the right faith. So, do not wrong yourself therein. ¹²And fight the
Mushriks all together, as they fight you all together, and be sure
that Allah is with the God-fearing.</item>
        <item>Nasi’ (i.e. postponement of months) is nothing but a
further excess in infidelity, whereby the disbelievers are misguided.
They allow it one year and disallow it another year, so that they may
conform (only) to the number of what Allah has sanctified, ¹³and allow
what Allah has disallowed. The evil of their deeds has been beautified
for them (by Satan). And Allah does not lead the disbelieving people
to the right path.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, what is wrong with you that when it
is said to you, “Come out in the way of Allah,” you turn heavy (and
cling) to the ground. Have you become happy with the worldly life
instead of the Hereafter? So, (remember that) the enjoyment of the
worldly life is but trivial in (comparison with) the Hereafter.
¹⁴</item>
        <item>If you do not march forth (in the way of Allah), He will
chastise you with a painful punishment and will replace you with
another nation, and you can do Him no harm at all. Allah is powerful
to do anything.</item>
        <item>If you do not help him, (it makes no difference to the
Prophet, because) Allah has already helped him when the disbelievers
expelled him, and he was the second of the two, when they were in the
cave, and he was saying to his companion, “Do not grieve. Allah is
surely with us.” ¹⁵ So, Allah caused His tranquility to descend on
him,and supported him with troops that you did not see, and rendered
the word of the disbelievers humiliated. And the word of Allah is the
uppermost. Allah</item>
        <item>March forth (in the way of Allah), no matter whether you
are light or heavy, and carry out Jihad (struggle) in the way of Allah
with your wealth and lives. That is good for you, if you were to
realize.</item>
        <item>Had it been a gain at hand or an average journey, they
would have certainly followed you, but the distance seemed too far to
them. They will swear by Allah: “We would have certainly set out with
you, if we were able to.” They are putting themselves to ruin. ¹⁶Allah
knows that they are liars.</item>
        <item>O Prophet,) Allah has forgiven you; why did you permit
them (to stay in Madinah) before the truthful ones could become
distinct to you, and you could be sure of the liars.</item>
        <item>Those who believe in Allah and in the Last Day do not
ask you to excuse them from Jihad with their wealth and lives. Allah
is aware of the God-fearing.</item>
        <item>Only those people ask you to be excused who do not
believe in Allah and in the Last Day and whose hearts are in doubt; so
they are wavering in their doubt.</item>
        <item>Had they wished to set out, they would have made some
preparation for it, but Allah disliked their going forth, ¹⁷so He made
them lag behind, and it was said to them, “Stay back with those who
are staying back.”</item>
        <item>And had they set out with you, they would have added
nothing for you but trouble, and would have run around in your midst
seeking mischief against you. Still, among you there are those who spy
for them. Allah is aware of the wrongdoers.</item>
        <item>They sought mischief even earlier and tried to upset
matters for you, until the Truth arrived and the will of Allah
prevailed, though they disliked it.</item>
        <item>And among them there is one who says, “Allow me (to stay
behind) and do not expose me to an ordeal.” ¹⁸Look! They have already
fallen into an ordeal, and certainly Jahannam (the Hell) has the
disbelievers encircled.</item>
        <item>If some good comes to you, it annoys them, and if
hardship befalls you, they say, “We had already taken care of our
problem”, and they go their way delighted.</item>
        <item>Say, “Nothing can ever reach us except what Allah has
destined for us. He is our Master. And in Allah alone the believers
must place their trust.”</item>
        <item>Say, “What you are expecting for us is nothing but one
of the two good things (martyrdom or victory). And we are expecting
for you that Allah sends to you a punishment from Himself or at our
hands. So, wait. Of course, we are waiting with you.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Spend, willingly or unwillingly, it will never be
accepted from you. You have been a sinning people.”</item>
        <item>Nothing has prevented their spending from being accepted
from them but that they have disbelieved in Allah and in His
Messenger, and they do not come to the Salah but lazily, and do not
spend but without volition.</item>
        <item>So, their wealth and their children should not attract
you. In fact, Allah intends to punish them with these in this lowly
life and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers.
</item>
        <item>They swear by Allah that they are from among you,
whereas they are not from among you, but they are a people in fear.
</item>
        <item>If they find a place of refuge or caves or any place to
enter, they will turn towards it running (as) unbridled (horses).
</item>
        <item>And among them there are those who find fault with you
in (the distribution of) Sadaqat (alms). So, if they are given
something out of it, they are quite happy, and if they are given
nothing from it, they at once get annoyed.</item>
        <item>Would that they were content with what Allah and His
Messenger had given to them, and were to say, “Allah is sufficient for
us; Allah and His Messenger will give us (more) out of His grace (when
they so will). Indeed, we crave for (the pleasure of) Allah
alone.”</item>
        <item>The Sadaqat (prescribed alms) are (meant) only to be
given to the poor, the needy, to those employed to collect them, to
those whose hearts are to be won, ¹⁹in the cause of the slaves and
those encumbered with debt, in the way of Allah and to a wayfarer.
This is an obligation prescribed by Allah. Allah is All-Knowing, Wise.
</item>
        <item>And among them (the hypocrites) there are those who hurt
the Prophet and say, “He is just an ear” (that is, he hears and
believes everything). Say, “He gives ear to that which is good for
you; he believes in Allah and trusts the believers and is a mercy for
those of you who (pretend to) believe.” ²⁰And those who hurt the
Messenger of Allah, for them there is a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>O believers,) they swear by Allah before you, so that
they may please you, whereas Allah, as well as His Messenger, has
greater right that they should please Him, if they are (true)
believers.</item>
        <item>Have they not come to know that whoever opposes Allah
and His Messenger, definite for him is the fire of Jahannam (Hell)
wherein he will remain forever. That is the extreme disgrace.</item>
        <item>The hypocrites are afraid that a Surah (a chapter of the
Holy Qur’an) may be sent down about them, which tells them what lies
in their hearts. Say, “Go on mocking. Allah is surely to bring out
what you are afraid of.”</item>
        <item>And if you ask them, they will say, “We were just
chatting and having fun.” Say, ²¹“Is it of Allah and His verses and
His Messenger that you were making fun?”</item>
        <item>Make no excuses. You became disbelievers (by mocking at
Allah and His Messenger) after you had professed Faith. If We forgive
some of you (who repent and believe), We shall punish others (who
carry on their hypocrisy), because they were guilty.</item>
        <item>The hypocrites, males and females, are all alike. They
bid vice and forbid virtue and withhold their hands (from spending in
Allah’s way). They forgot Allah, so He forgot them. Surely, the
hypocrites are the sinners.</item>
        <item>Allah has promised the fire of Jahannam to the
hypocrites, men and women, and to the disbelievers who shall live
there forever. It is adequate for them. Allah has put His curse on
them, and for them there is a lasting punishment.</item>
        <item>You are) like those who were before you. They were
stronger than you in power, and richer in wealth and children. So,
they enjoyed their share (from the pleasures of this world), then you
enjoyed your share as those before you enjoyed their share, and you
indulged (in evils) as they indulged. They are the ones whose deeds
have gone to waste in this world and in the Hereafter, and they are
the losers.</item>
        <item>Has there not reached them the news of those before
them, the people of Nuh and ‘Ad and Thamud and the people of Ibrahim
and the people of Madyan, and (the news) of the towns overturned?
²²Their messengers came to them with clear signs; so, Allah was not
such as would wrong them, but they have been doing wrong to their own
selves.</item>
        <item>The believers, male and female, are friends to each
other. They bid virtue and forbid vice and establish Salah and pay
Zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Those are the ones whom Allah
will bless with mercy. Surely, Allah is Powerful, Wise.</item>
        <item>Allah has promised to the believers, male and female,
gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they shall live forever, and
good homes in gardens of eternity. And Allah’s pleasure is above all.
That is the supreme success.</item>
        <item>O Prophet, carry out Jihad (struggle) against the
disbelievers and hypocrites, ²³and be strict with them. And their
abode is Jahannam (Hell), and it is an evil terminus.</item>
        <item>They swear by Allah that they said nothing, while
indeed, they had said the word of infidelity and had disbelieved after
having accepted Islam, and had intended what they could not achieve. ²⁴
And they have reacted for nothing but that Allah and His Messenger
have enriched them with His grace. So, if they repent, it will be good
for them, and if they turn away, Allah will chastise them with a
painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and for them there
is neither a frie</item>
        <item>And among them there are those who made a pledge with
Allah: “If He gives us (wealth) out of His grace, then, surely we
shall give alms and shall be among the righteous.”</item>
        <item>But when He gave them (wealth) out of His grace, they
became stingy about it, and went back turning their faces away.</item>
        <item>So Allah, in turn, put hypocrisy in their hearts till
the day they shall meet Him, because they broke their promise with
Allah, and because they have been telling lies.</item>
        <item>Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and
what they whisper, and that Allah is well aware of all the Unseen?
</item>
        <item>Among the hypocrites, there are) those who taunt the
believers who voluntarily give alms and have nothing but their hard
earnings; still they mock at such people. Allah mocks at them, and for
them there is a painful punishment. ²⁵</item>
        <item>It is all equal whether you) ask pardon for them or do
not ask pardon for them. Even if you ask pardon for them seventy
times, Allah will never pardon them. That is because they disbelieved
in Allah and His Messenger. Allah does not lead the sinning people to
the right path.</item>
        <item>Those who were left behind were happy with their sitting
back to the displeasure of the Messenger of Allah, and they disliked
carrying out Jihad in the way of Allah with their wealth and lives,
and they said, “Do not march in this hot weather.” Say, “The fire of
Jahannam is much more intense in heat,” only if they could understand.
</item>
        <item>So, let them laugh a little, and weep a lot, this being
a reward of what they used to earn.</item>
        <item>Then, if Allah brings you back to a group of them and
they seek your permission to march, ²⁶say to them, “You shall never
march with me ever after, and shall never fight an enemy in my
company. You were happy with sitting back the first time; now, sit
with those remaining behind”</item>
        <item>And never offer a prayer on any one of them who dies,
and do not stand by his grave. ²⁷They disbelieved in Allah and His
Messenger and died while they were sinners.</item>
        <item>Their wealth and children should not attract you. Allah
only wills to punish them with these in this world and that their
souls depart while they are disbelievers.</item>
        <item>When a Surah is revealed (saying), “Believe in Allah and
carry out Jihad in the company of His Messenger” the capable ones from
them seek your permission and say, “Let us remain with those sitting
back.”</item>
        <item>They are happy to be with women who sit back, and their
hearts are sealed; so they do not understand.</item>
        <item>But the Messenger and the believers in his company have
carried out Jihad with their wealth and lives, and for them there are
the good things, and they are the successful.</item>
        <item>Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers
flow where they will live forever. That is the supreme achievement.
</item>
        <item>And the excuse-makers from the Bedouins came, so that
they might be allowed (to stay behind), while those who were false to
Allah and His Messengers (just) stayed behind (without seeking
permission). A painful punishment is about to fall upon those of them
who disbelieve.</item>
        <item>There is no blame on the weak, or on the sick, or on
those who have nothing to spend, if they are sincere to Allah and His
Messenger. There is no way against those who are good in deeds. Allah
is most Forgiving, Very Merciful.</item>
        <item>Nor (is there any blame) on those who, when they came to
you so that you might provide them with a carrier (that they could
ride for Jihad ) and you said (to them), “I find no carrier to give to
you”, went back with their eyes flowing with tears in grief, because
they had nothing to spend.</item>
        <item>Blame lies, in fact, on those who ask you permission
despite being rich. They are happy being with women who sit back.
Allah has sealed their hearts; so they do not know.</item>
        <item>They will make excuses to you when you return to them.
Say, “Do not make excuses. We shall never believe you. Allah has told
us the facts about you. Allah will see what you do, and His Messenger
as well. Then you shall be returned to the Knower of the Seen and the
Unseen, and He will tell you what you have been doing.”</item>
        <item>They will swear by Allah before you when you will go
back to them, so that you may ignore their misdeeds. So, just ignore
them. They are filth, and their abode is Jahannam, a recompense for
what they used to do.</item>
        <item>They swear before you, so that you may be pleased with
them. So, even if you are pleased with them, Allah will not be pleased
with the sinning people.</item>
        <item>The Bedouins are often more strict in disbelief and
hypocrisy, and are most likely to be ignorant of the limits of what
Allah has sent down to His Messenger. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
</item>
        <item>And among the Bedouins there are those who take what
they spend as a fine, and they look forward to the cycles of time to
turn against you. ²⁸Upon those is the evil cycle. And Allah is AllHearing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>And among the Bedouins there are others who believe in
Allah and in the Last Day and take what they spend as a source of
nearness to Allah and of prayers from the Messenger. It is indeed a
source of nearness for them. Allah will admit them to His mercy.
Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Very Merciful.</item>
        <item>As for the first and foremost of the Emigrants
(Muhajirin) and the Supporters (Ansar) and those who followed them in
goodness, Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Allah,
and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, where
they will live for ever. That is the supreme achievement.</item>
        <item>And among those Bedouins who are around you there are
hypocrites, and among the people of Madinah as well. They are adamant
on hypocrisy. You do not know them. We know them. We will chastise
them twice, ²⁹then they shall be driven to a terrible punishment (in
the Hereafter).</item>
        <item>And there are others who admitted their sins while they
had mixed agood deed with an evil one. It is likely that Allah will
relent towards them. Surely, Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Take sadaqah (obligatory alms) out of their wealth
through which you may cleanse and purify them, and pray for them.
Indeed, your prayer is a source of peace for them. And Allah is (All-)
Hearing, (All-) Knowing.</item>
        <item>Have theynot come to know that Allah is He who accepts
repentance from His slaves and accepts Sadaqat, and that Allah is
Most-Relenting, Very-Merciful?</item>
        <item>Say, “Do (what you do); Allah will see your deed, as
will the Messenger and the believers. And you shall be returned to the
Knower of the Seen and the Unseen, then He will tell you what you have
been doing.”</item>
        <item>And there are others whose matter is deferred till the
command of Allah (comes): either He would punish them or relent
towards them. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. ³⁰</item>
        <item>And (there are) those who have built a mosque to cause
harm (to Islam) and to promote infidelity and to create dissention
among the believers and to provide a station for one who has been at
war with Allah and His Messenger even before. ³¹They will certainly
swear (and say), “We intended to do nothing but good.” Allah testifies
that they are liars.</item>
        <item>Do not ever stand there (in prayer). In fact, the mosque
that was founded on Taqwa (piety) from the very first day has greater
right that you stand in it. ³²In it there are people who like to
observe purity; and Allah loves those observing purity.</item>
        <item>Then tell me, which one is better, whether the one who
has founded his building on fear of Allah and on search of His
pleasure, or the one who has founded his building on the edge of an
abyss that is about to collapse, then it did collapse with him into
the fire of Jahannam ? Allah does not give guidance to the unjust
people.</item>
        <item>The building they had built shall always remain a source
of unrest in their hearts, unless their hearts are cut into pieces.
³³Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah has bought their lives and their wealth
from the believers, in exchange of (a promise) that Paradise shall be
theirs. They fight in the way of Allah, and kill and are killed, on
which there is a true promise (as made) in the Torah and the Injil and
the Qur’an. And who can be more faithful to his covenant than Allah?
So, rejoice in the deal you have made, and that is the great
achievement.</item>
        <item>They are) those who repent, those who worship, those who
praise (Allah), those who journey (in Allah’s way), those who bow in
Ruku‘, those who prostrate in sajdah, those who bid the Fair and
forbid the Unfair and those who preserve the limits prescribed by
Allah. And give the good news to the believers.</item>
        <item>It is not (permissible) for the Prophet and the
believers to seek forgiveness for the Mushriks, even if they are
kinsmen, after it became clear to them that they are the people of
hell.</item>
        <item>As for the prayer of Ibrahim for the forgiveness of his
father, it was only due to a promise he had made to him. Later, when
it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he withdrew
himself from him. Indeed, Ibrahim was very tender-hearted, very
forbearing.</item>
        <item>Allah is not such as He makes a people go astray after
He has given them guidance, unless He explains to them what they
should avoid. Indeed, Allah is fully aware of every thing.</item>
        <item>Surely, to Allah alone belongs the kingdom of the
heavens and the earth. He gives life and brings death. And, other than
Allah, you have neither a supporter, nor a helper.</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah has relented towards the Prophet and the
Emigrants (Muhajirin) and the Supporters (the Ansar) who followed him
in the hour of hardship after the hearts of a group of them were about
to turn crooked, then He relented towards them. Surely, to them He is
Very-Kind, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>And (He relented) towards the three whose matter was
deferred until when the earth was straitened for them despite all its
vastness, and even their own souls were straitened for them, and they
realized that there is no refuge from Allah, except in Him, then He
turned towards them, so that they may repent. Surely, Allah is the
Most-Relenting, the Very Merciful. ³⁴</item>
        <item>O you who believe, fear Allah, and be in the company of
the truthful.</item>
        <item>It was not (permissible) for the people of Madinah and
for those around them of the Bedouins to stay behind abandoning the
Messenger of Allah, nor to prefer their own lives to his life. That is
because whatever thirst or fatigue or hunger strikes them in the way
of Allah, and whenever theystep into a place which infuriates the
infidels, and whenever they make a gain from an enemy, a virtuous deed
is thereby credited to their account. Surely, Allah does not nullify
the reward of the virtuous.</item>
        <item>Whatever they spend, be it less or more, and whenever
they cross a valley, is all written down for them, so that Allah may
give them the best reward for what they used to do.</item>
        <item>It is not (necessary) for all the believers to go forth.
³⁵ so, why should it not be that a group from every section of them
goes forth, so that they may acquire perfect understanding of the
Faith, and so that they may warn their people when they return to
them, so that they may take due care (of the rules of Shari‘ah ).
</item>
        <item>O you who believe, fight those disbelievers who are near
you, and let them find severity in you. Know well that Allah is with
the God-fearing.</item>
        <item>When a Surah is sent down, some of them (the hypocrites)
say, “Whose faith from among you has been increased by this?” So far
as the believers are concerned, it has certainly increased their
faith, and they are quite happy.</item>
        <item>As for those who have malady in their hearts, it adds
further impurity to their (initial) impurity, and they die infidels.
</item>
        <item>Do they not see that they are put to trial every year
once or twice; ³⁶still they neither repent, nor do they take lesson?
</item>
        <item>And when a Surah is sent down, they look at each other
(as if saying): “Is there someone watching you?” Then they turn away.
³⁷Allah has turned their hearts, because they are a people who do not
understand.</item>
        <item>Surely, there has come to you, from your midst, a
Messenger who feels it very hard on him if you face a hardship, who is
very anxious for your welfare, and for the believers he is very kind,
very merciful.</item>
        <item>So, if they turn away, say (O Messenger,) “Enough for me
is Allah. There is no god but He. In Him I have placed my trust, and
He is the Lord of the Great Throne.”</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Alif, Lam, Ra. ¹These are verses of the Wise Book.
</item>
        <item>Is it surprising for the people that We have sent the
divine revelation to a man from among them to direct him that he
should warn the people (who are heedless), and give happy news to
those who believe that they will have a truly excellent footing at a
place near their Lord? The disbelievers said, “Surely, he is an open
sorcerer.”</item>
        <item>Surely, your Lord is Allah, the One who created the
heavens and the earth in six days, and then He positioned Himself on
the Throne.²He governs all affairs (of His creation). There is no one
who could intercede before Him, except after His permission. ³That is
Allah, your Lord. So, worship Him. Would you still pay no heed?</item>
        <item>Towards Him all of you have to return, this being a true
promise from Allah. Surely, He originates the creation; then He will
bring it again, so that He may justly reward those who believe and do
good deeds. As for those who disbelieve, for them there is a drink of
boiling water and a painful punishment, because they used to be
infidels.</item>
        <item>He is the One who has made the sun a glow, and the moon
a light, and determined for it stages, so that you may learn the
number of the years, and the calculation (of time). Allah has not
created all this but for a rightful purpose. ⁴He elaborates the signs
for a people who understand.</item>
        <item>Surely, in the alternation of night and day and in what
Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are signs for a
people who are God-fearing.</item>
        <item>As for those who do not believe in meeting Us and are
quite happy with the life of this world and are content with it, and
those who are heedless to Our signs,</item>
        <item>They are the ones whose abode is the Fire, because of
what they used to earn for themselves.</item>
        <item>As for those who believe and do good deeds, their Lord
will guide them by virtue of their belief; rivers will be flowing
beneath them in the Gardens of Bliss.</item>
        <item>Their call therein will be, “Pure are You, O Allah” and
their greeting therein will be Salam . And the end of their call will
be, “Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.”</item>
        <item>And if Allah were to hasten in sending evil to the
people, as they hasten in seeking good, their time would have been all
over. ⁵So, We leave alone those who do not believe in meeting Us to
wander blindly in their rebellion.</item>
        <item>When man is afflicted by a hardship, he prays to Us (at
all times), when reclining or sitting or standing. But when We remove
his hardship, he just takes his way as though he had never prayed to
Us in any hardship that afflicted him. This is how their deeds appear
beautified to the transgressors.</item>
        <item>Indeed We have destroyed generations before you when
they transgressed, and their Messengers had come to them with clear
signs, but they were not the ones who would believe. This is how We
punish the guilty people.</item>
        <item>Then We made you (their) successors in the land after
them, so that We see how you would act.</item>
        <item>When Our verses are recited to them in all their
clarity, say those who do not believe in meeting Us, “Bring a Qur’an
other than this, or make changes in it (to suit our fancies)”. Say,
“It is not possible for me to make changes in it on my own. I follow
nothing but what is revealed to me. IfI disobey my Lord, I fear the
punishment of a terrible day.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Had Allah so willed, I would have not recited it
to you, nor would He have let you know it. Then, I have lived among
you for years before it. Have you, then, no sense?” ⁶</item>
        <item>So, who is more unjust than the one who forges a lie
against Allah or gives the lie to His signs? Indeed (such) guilty
people shall not achieve success.</item>
        <item>Beside Allah, they worship those who can neither harm
nor benefit them, and they say, “These are our intercessors with
Allah.” Say, “Are you informing Allah of what He does not know as
existing in the heavens or on the earth?” Pure is He, and far higher
than what they associate with Him.</item>
        <item>All the people were no more than a single community;
later, they differed. ⁷But for a word from your Lord that had already
come to pass, a decisive judgment would have been made about their
mutual differences. ⁸</item>
        <item>And they say, “Why is it that no sign has been sent down
to him from his Lord?” Say, “The Unseen is only for Allah. So, wait. I
am waiting with you.” ⁹</item>
        <item>Once We cause people to taste a blessing after a
hardship having afflicted them, they at once start devising plans
against Our verses. Say, Allah is swifter in implementing His plan.
Indeed, Our messengers (angels) record whatever you intrigue.</item>
        <item>He is the One who enables you to travel on land and at
sea, until when you are aboard the boats, and they sail with those on
board, under a favorable wind, and they are pleased with it, there
comes upon them a violent wind, and the wave comes upon them from
every direction, and they think that they are surrounded from all
sides, they pray to Allah, having faith in Him alone, (and say,) “If
You deliver us from this, we shall be grateful indeed.”</item>
        <item>But when He delivers them, they at once start rebelling
on the earth wrongfully. O people, your rebellion is, in fact, against
your own selves. It is only worldly life that you are enjoying.
Thereafter, it is to Us that you have to return; then We will tell you
what you have been doing.</item>
        <item>The example of worldly life is just like the water We
sent down from the sky, then the vegetation of the earth grew with it,
which is (meant to be) eaten by men and cattle, until when the earth
took on its ornament and was fully adorned, and its people thought
that they had control over it, Our command came to it at night or by
day, and We turned it into a stubble, as if it had not been there a
day earlier. This is how We elaborate the verses for a people who
reflect.</item>
        <item>Allah invites (people) to the Abode of Peace and brings
whom He wills to a straight path.</item>
        <item>For those who do good there is the best, and something
more. Neither gloom shall cover their faces, nor disgrace. Those are
the people of Paradise. Therein they shall live forever.</item>
        <item>As for those who commit evils, the recompense of each
evil shall be similar to that evil, and disgrace shall cover them. For
them, there is none to save from Allah. Their faces will seem to be
covered with layers of a dark night. Those are the people of the Fire.
Therein they shall live forever.</item>
        <item>And (be mindful of) the Day when We shall gather them
together, then We shall say to those who associated partners with
Allah, “Wait in your place, you and your associate-gods.” Then We will
cause a split between them, and their associate-gods will say, “It was
not us that you worshipped.</item>
        <item>So, Allah is enough as witness between us and between
you. We were totally unaware of your worship.”</item>
        <item>Thereupon, everyone shall assess what one had sent
ahead, and they will be sent back to Allah, their true Lord, and
whatever they used to fabricate will vanish from them.</item>
        <item>Say, “Who gives you sustenance from the heavens and the
earth? Or, who controls the (powers of) hearing and seeing? And who
brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from
the living? And who manages everything?” They will say, “Allah.” Then,
(you) say, “Would you not, then, fear Allah (by desisting from holding
others as gods)?”</item>
        <item>So, that is Allah, your Lord in truth. And what is there
after truth but error? To where, then, are you being diverted (by your
whims)?</item>
        <item>This is how the Word of your Lord has come true about
the sinners that they will not believe.</item>
        <item>Say, “Is there any one from your ‘associate-gods’ who
originates the creation, then brings it again? Say, “It is Allah who
originates the creation then brings it again.” To where then, are you
being turned away (by your desires)?”</item>
        <item>Say, “Is there any one from your associate-gods who
guides to the truth?” Say, “Allah guides to the truth. Is, then, He
who guides to the truth more worthy of being obeyed, or he who has no
guidance at all unless he is guided (by someone else)? ¹⁰So, what has
happened to you? How do you judge things?</item>
        <item>Most of them follow nothing but conjectures. Surely,
conjectures are of no avail in the matter of truth at all. Certainly,
Allah is fully aware of what they do.</item>
        <item>And this Qur’an is not such as could have been made up
by someone without (having been revealed by) Allah, but it is a
confirmation of that (discourse) which had been (revealed) before it,
and an elaboration of what is prescribed. ¹¹There is no doubt in it.
It is from the Lord of all the worlds.</item>
        <item>Or, do they say that he has made it up? Say, “Then,
bring a Surah like this, and call whomsoever you can beside Allah, if
you are true.”</item>
        <item>But they have rejected a thing they could not comprehend
with knowledge, while its ultimate end has not appeared to them as
yet. ¹²Similarly those who passed before them had rejected the truth.
So, look how was the fate of the unjust.</item>
        <item>And among them there are those who believe in it, and
among them there are others who do not believe in it. And your Lord
has the best knowledge about the mischief-makers.</item>
        <item>And if they give the lie to you, say, “For me, my deed,
and for you, your deed. You are not accountable for what I do, and I
am not accountable for what you do.”</item>
        <item>And among them there are those who listen to you. Would
you, then, make the deaf hear, even though they lack understanding?
</item>
        <item>And among them there are those who look at you. Would
you, then, guide the blind even when they have no insight?</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah does not wrong people at all, but the
people do wrong their own selves.</item>
        <item>The Day when He will gather them (in the next life,)
they will feel as if they had not stayed (in the world) any longer
than a fraction of a day. They will recognize each other. Losers,
indeed, are those who deny that they will ever face Allah; they are
not on the right path.</item>
        <item>No matter whether We show you (during your life) some of
what We warn them of, or We take you back to Us (before it), in any
case, they have to return to Us. Then, Allah is witness to what they
do.</item>
        <item>For every people there is a messenger. So, when their
messenger comes, the matter is decided between them with justice, and
they are not wronged.</item>
        <item>They say, “When will this promise (of punishment to the
disbelievers) be fulfilled if you are true?”</item>
        <item>Say, “I have no power to bring a harm or a benefit to
myself, except what Allah wills. For every people there is an
appointed time. When their time comes, they are not able to put it off
for a moment, nor are they able to go ahead of it.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Just tell me, if His punishment befalls you at
night or by day, what (desirable thing) will it have that the sinners
are asking it so hurriedly?</item>
        <item>Is it only when it befalls you that you will believe in
it? (It will be said to you at that time, “Have you believed) now,
while you used to demand (in mockery) that it should come
sooner?”</item>
        <item>Then it will be said to the unjust, “Taste the
punishment lasting for ever. You shall not be punished except for what
you have been earning.”</item>
        <item>They ask you to tell them whether it is true. Say, “Yes,
by my Lord, it is true. And you cannot frustrate (Allah’s
plan).”</item>
        <item>If anyone who did wrong possesses all that is on the
earth, he would (agree to) ransom himself with it. And they will
conceal their remorse when they will see the punishment. And the
matter will be decided between them with justice and they will not be
wronged.</item>
        <item>Look! To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and
the earth. Look! Allah’s promise is certainly true, but most of them
do not know.</item>
        <item>He giveslife and brings death, and to Him you shall be
returned.</item>
        <item>O men, there has come to you an advice from your Lord,
and a cure for the ailments of your hearts, and guidance and mercy for
the believers.</item>
        <item>Say, “With the grace of Allah and with His mercy (this
book hasbeen revealed). So they should rejoice in it. It is much
better than that (wealth) which they accumulate.</item>
        <item>Say, “Have you ever considered, whatever provision Allah
has sent down for your benefit, you have made up unlawful and lawful
from it?” ¹³ say, “Has Allah permitted you or are you fabricating a
lie against Allah?”</item>
        <item>What is the assumption of those who fabricate a lie
against Allah (about) the Day of Judgment? Indeed Allah is gracious to
people, but most of them are not grateful.</item>
        <item>In whatever condition you are, and whatever portion of
the Qur’an you recite therein, and whatever work you all do, We are
present before you when you are engaged in it. Hidden from your Lord
is nothing even to the measure of a particle on the earth or in the
heavens. And there is nothing smaller or greater that is not in the
clear Book.</item>
        <item>Listen, the friends of Allah shall have no fear, nor
shall they grieve</item>
        <item>Those who have believed and have been fearful of Allah.
</item>
        <item>For them there is the good news in the worldly life and
in the Hereafter: there is no change in the words of Allah.That is the
great achievement.</item>
        <item>O Prophet,) what they say should not make you grieve.
Surely, all power belongs to Allah. He is All-Hearing, All Knowing.
</item>
        <item>Listen, to Allah belong all those in the heavens and all
those on the earth. And those who invoke associate-gods besides Allah
do not follow a reality. They follow nothing but whims and do nothing
but make conjectures.</item>
        <item>He is the One who made for you the night, so that you
may have rest in it, and (made) the day to see. Indeed, there are
signs therein for a people who listen.</item>
        <item>They say, “Allah has got a son.” Pure is He. He is SelfSufficient. To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the
earth. You have no proof for it. Do you allege about Allah what you do
not know?</item>
        <item>Say: Those who fabricate lies against Allah shall not
prosper.</item>
        <item>It will be a little enjoyment in this world; thereafter
to Us they are bound to return; then We shall make them taste the
severe punishment, because they used to disbelieve.</item>
        <item>Recite to them the story of (the Prophet) Nuh (Noah),
¹⁴when he said to his people, “O my people, if it is hard on you that I
stay (with you) and give (you) advice through the signs of Allah,
then, in Allah I place my trust. So, be firm in your plan (against me)
with (the help of) all your partners, and your plan should not be a
cause of concern for you; then carry it out against me and give me no
respite. ¹⁵</item>
        <item>Still, if you turn away, then, I did not demand any
reward from you. My reward is with none except Allah, and I have been
commanded to be among those who submit.”</item>
        <item>Then they rejected him, and We saved him and those with
him in the Ark and made them the successors, and drowned those who
gave the lie to Our signs. So look how was the fate of those who were
warned.</item>
        <item>Then, after him, We sent messengers to their peoples,
and they came to them with clear signs, but they were not to believe
in what they had rejected earlier. This is how We seal the hearts of
the transgressors.</item>
        <item>Then, after them, We sent Musa ¹⁶and Harun with Our signs
to Pharaoh and his group, but they showed arrogance. And they were
surely a guilty people.</item>
        <item>So, when Truth came to them from Us, they said, “It is
certainly a clear magic.”</item>
        <item>Musa said, “Do you say (this) about the Truth when it
came to you? Is this magic, while the magicians do not achieve
success?”</item>
        <item>They said, “Have you come to us to turn us away from the
way on which we have found our fathers, and so that you both have
supremacy on earth? We are not going to believe in you.”</item>
        <item>And Pharaoh said, “Bring to me every knowledgeable
magician.”</item>
        <item>So, when the magicians came, Musa said to them, “Cast
what you have to cast.”</item>
        <item>So, when they had cast, Musa said, “All that you have
brought is magic. Allah will certainly bring it to naught. Be assured
that Allah does not set right the work of the mischief-makers.”</item>
        <item>And Allah establishes the truth through His words, even
though the guilty ones may dislike it.</item>
        <item>Then, except some youths of his people, no one believed
in Musa for the fear of Pharaoh and his group, lest he should
persecute them. Pharaoh was high-handed in the land and he was of
those who crossed all limits.</item>
        <item>And Musa said, “My people, if you have believed in
Allah, then, in Him place your trust if you are obedient.”</item>
        <item>So, they said, “In Allah we have placed our trust: Our
Lord, do not make us a victim of the unjust people,</item>
        <item>And save us, through Your mercy, from the disbelieving
people.”</item>
        <item>And We revealed to Musa and his brother: “Have houses
for your people in Egypt, and make your houses worship oriented, ¹⁷and
establish Salah, and give good tidings to the believers.”</item>
        <item>Musa said, “Our Lord, You have given Pharaoh and his
group glamour and riches in the worldly life, so that, our Lord, they
mislead (people) from Your path. Our Lord, obliterate their riches and
harden their hearts, so that they may not come to believe until they
witness the painful punishment.”</item>
        <item>Allah said, “The prayer of the two of you has been
granted; so stand firm, and never follow the way of the
ignorant.”</item>
        <item>And We let the children of Isra’il cross the sea. So,
Pharaoh and his troops chased them in transgression and hostility,
until when he was about to drown, he said, “I believe that there is no
god but the One in whom the children of Isra’il believe, and I am
among those who submit to Allah.”</item>
        <item>Allah said,) “Is it now (that you have come to believe)
while you were rebellious all along, and you were among the mischiefmakers?</item>
        <item>So, today, We shall save your body, so that you may
become a sign for those after you. ¹⁸And many of the people are
heedless of Our signs.”</item>
        <item>And surely We gave the children of Isra’il a proper
place to live, and provided them with good things. Then they did not
disagree between themselves but after knowledge had come to them.
¹⁹Surely, Allah will decide between them on the Day of Judgment about
the matters in which they used to dispute each other.</item>
        <item>So, (O prophet,) even if you are in doubt about what We
have sent down to you, ask those who read the Book (revealed) before
you. ²⁰ Surely,truth has come to you from your Lord, so never be among
those who are suspicious.</item>
        <item>And never be among those who have rejected Allah’s
signs,lest you should be among the losers.</item>
        <item>Surely, those against whom the Word of your Lord stands
settled will not believe,</item>
        <item>Even though every sign comes to them, unless they
witness the painful punishment.</item>
        <item>So, how is it that there never was a town, which could
have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except
the people of Yunus? When they came to believe, We removed from them
the punishment of humiliation in the worldly life and let them enjoy
themselves for some time. ²¹</item>
        <item>Had your Lord willed, all those on earth would have
believed altogether. Would you, then, compel people, so that they
become believers? ²²</item>
        <item>It is not (possible) for any one that he believes except
with the will of Allah. And He makes filth settle on those who do not
understand.</item>
        <item>Say, “Look at what is there in the heavens and the
earth.” But, signs and warnings do not suffice a people who do not
believe.</item>
        <item>So, are they waiting for nothing short of something like
the days of those who have passed before them? Say, “So wait. I am
with you, among those who are waiting.”</item>
        <item>Then We (used to) save Our messengers and those who
believed. Similarly, it being undertaken by Us, We shall save the
believers.</item>
        <item>Say, “O people, if you are in doubt about my Faith,
then, I do not worship those whom you worship beside Allah. Rather, I
worship Allah who brings death to you. And I have been ordained to be
among the believers,</item>
        <item>And that I should make myself firm on Faith, being
upright, and never should be among the Mushriks (who ascribe partners
to Allah).”</item>
        <item>And do not invoke, other than Allah, what neither
benefits you nor harms you, for, if you do so, then you will surely be
one of the unjust.</item>
        <item>If Allah brings some harm to you, there is none to
remove it except He. And if He intends to bring some good to you,
there is none to turn His grace back. He brings it to whomever He
wills from among His servants. He is the Most-Forgiving, the Very
Merciful.</item>
        <item>Say, “O people, the truth has come to you from your
Lord. So, whoever accepts guidance accepts it to his own benefit, and
whoever goes astray does so to his own detriment. And I am not
responsible for you.”</item>
        <item>Follow what is being revealed to you, and be patient
until Allah gives His judgment, and He is the best of all judges.
</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Alif , Lam , Ra . ¹(This is) a book the verses of which
have been made firm, and elaborated by the One who is All Wise, All
Aware,</item>
        <item>Directing the Prophet to say to the people,) “You must
not worship anyone other than Allah; I am for you a warner from Him,
and a bearer of glad tidings;</item>
        <item>And you must seek forgiveness from your Lord, then, turn
to Him in repentance, and He will provide you with good things to
enjoy for a given time, and bestow His extra favor on everyone who has
extra good deeds (in his account). And if you turn away, then, I fear
for you the punishment of a terrible day.</item>
        <item>To Allah is your return, and He is powerful over
everything.”</item>
        <item>Beware, they bend their chests to hide from Him. Beware,
when they cover up themselves with their clothes, He knows what they
hide and what they expose. ²Surely, He is All Aware of what lies in
the hearts.</item>
        <item>There is no creature on earth whose sustenance is not
undertaken by Allah. He knows its permanent and its temporary place.
Everything is in a clear book.</item>
        <item>He is the One who created the heavens and the earth in
six days, while His throne was on water, so that He might test you as
to who among you is better in deed. And if you say, “You shall be
raised after death,” the disbelievers will surely say, “This is
nothing but sheer magic.”</item>
        <item>And if We defer the punishment for them for a certain
time, they will say, “What is holding it back?” Beware, the day it
will visit them, it shall not be turned back from them, and they shall
be besieged by what they used to ridicule.</item>
        <item>If We give man a taste of Our mercy and then take it
away from him, he becomes highly desperate, utterly ungrateful.</item>
        <item>And if We give him a taste of comfort after a hardship
has touched him, he will say, “Evils have gone away from me”, (and
thus) He will become over-exulting, boastful,</item>
        <item>Except those who are patient and do good deeds. Such
people will have Allah’s forgiveness and a great reward.</item>
        <item>Is it then possible from you (O Prophet,) that you will
abandon some of what is being revealed to you, and that your heart
will be straitened thereby, because they say, “Why has a treasure not
been sent down to him or an angel not come with him?” You are but a
warner. And Allah takes care of everything. ³</item>
        <item>Do they say that he has fabricated it? Say (to them),
“Then bring ten Surahs like this, fabricated. And call whomsoever you
can, other than Allah, if you are true.” ⁴</item>
        <item>So, if they do not respond to your call, then be assured
that it has been sent down with the knowledge of Allah and that there
is no god but He. So, do you submit?</item>
        <item>Those who seek (merely) the worldly life and its beauty,
We will fully recompense them herein for their acts, and their right
will not be curtailed in this world.</item>
        <item>Those are the people for whom there is nothing in the
Hereafter except fire. Nullified will be whatever they worked herein,
and void will be what they have been doing.</item>
        <item>⁵Then, can such people be equal to the one who has a
clear proof from his Lord, followed by an evidence from within, and
before which there was the Book of Musa, a guide and a mercy? ⁶Such
people believe in it; and whoever of the groups denies its veracity,
his promised place is the Fire. So, do not be in doubt about it.
Surely, it is the truth from your Lord, but most of people do not
believe.</item>
        <item>Who is more unjust than the one who forges a lie against
Allah? Such people will be presented before their Lord, and the
witnesses will say, “These are the ones who lied against their Lord.
Lo! the curse of Allah lies on the unjust,</item>
        <item>The ones who prevent (people) from the way of Allah and
seek crookedness in it, and who are deniers of the Hereafter.”</item>
        <item>They were unable to frustrate (Allah’s plan) on the
earth, and they had no supporters besides Allah. Punishment will be
doubled for them. They were not able to hear, nor would they see.
</item>
        <item>Those are the ones who brought loss to their own selves,
and all that they used to fabricate vanished from them.</item>
        <item>Essentially, they are the worst losers in the Hereafter.
</item>
        <item>Surely, those who believe and do good deeds and humble
themselves before their Lord, those are the people of Paradise. There
they shall live forever.</item>
        <item>The example of the two groups is that of a blind and
deaf person on the one hand, and a seeing and hearing one on the
other. Are the two equal when compared? Would you still pay no heed?
</item>
        <item>We sent Nuh to his people (saying to them): “I am here
to warn you</item>
        <item>That you should worship none but Allah, (otherwise) I
fear for you the punishment of a painful day.”</item>
        <item>So the chiefs of his people who disbelieved replied, “We
are not seeing that you are anything more than a man like us, and we
are not seeing that any people have followed you except those who are
the meanest among us having shallow opinion, and we have not seen in
you people any superiority over us; rather, we believe that you are
liars.”</item>
        <item>He said, “O my people, tell me, if I am on a clear path
from my Lord, and He has bestowed mercy upon me from Himself which is
hidden from your sight, shall we, then, impose it upon you by force,
while you are averse to it?</item>
        <item>And, O my people, I do not demand from you any wealth
for it. My reward is with none but Allah. And I am not the one who
could drive the believers away. ⁷ Surely, they will be meeting their
Lord (gracefully), but I do see your behavior is that of ignorance.
</item>
        <item>O my people, who would help me against (the punishment
of) Allah, if I were to drive them away? Would you still take no
lesson?</item>
        <item>And I do not say to you that I have the treasures of
Allah, nor that I have the knowledge of the unseen, nor do I say that
I am an angel. Nor do I say (as you do) about those who are
contemptible in your eyes that Allah will never award them any good;
Allah knows best what lies in their hearts. ⁸ (If I were to say so,)
then, I would indeed be one of the unjust.”</item>
        <item>They said, “O Nuh, you have debated with us, and debated
too much. Now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are one
of the truthful.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Only Allah will bring it to you, if He so
wills, and you cannot frustrate (His will).</item>
        <item>My good counsel will not profit you, even though I wish
you the best, if Allah wills to let you go astray. He is your Lord,
and to Him you shall be made to return.”</item>
        <item>Do they (the pagans of Makkah) still say that he
(Muhammad (S.A.W)) has forged it? Say, “If I have forged it, then, I
am responsible for my sin, and I am free of the sins you commit.”
⁹</item>
        <item>And it was revealed to Nuh: None of your people would
come to believe any more, except those who have already believed. So,
be not distressed by what they have been doing.</item>
        <item>And make an ark under Our eyes and according to Our
revelation; and do not speak to Me about those who have crossed the
limits, as they are destined to be drowned.”</item>
        <item>He started making the Ark. Whenever the leaders of his
people passed by him, they mocked at him. He said, “If you mock at us,
we mock at you like you mock at us:</item>
        <item>So, you shall soon know who will be visited by a scourge
that will humiliate him, and upon whom a lasting punishment will
settle forever.”</item>
        <item>At last, when Our command came and the oven overflowed,
¹⁰We said, “Take into the Ark a pair of two from every species, ¹¹along
with your family,__except those against whom the Word has already been
pronounced__and (also take into it) those who have believed.” And
there were only a few who had believed with him.</item>
        <item>He (Nuh) said, “Embark it. With the name of Allah it
sails and anchors. Surely, my Lord is Most-Forgiving, VeryMerciful.”</item>
        <item>And it was sailing with them amidst the waves like
mountains. And Nuh called out to his son, who was at an isolated
place, “O my child, come on board with us, and do not be in the
company of the disbelievers.”</item>
        <item>He said, “I shall take shelter on a mountain which will
save me from the water.” He said, “There is no saver today from the
command of Allah, except the one to whom He shows mercy.” And the
waves rose high between the two, and he was among those who were
drowned.</item>
        <item>It was said (by Allah), “O earth, suck in your water,
and O heaven, stop.” And water subsided, and the matter was over. It
(the Ark) came to rest on the Judi, ¹²and it was said, “Away with the
wrongdoers.”</item>
        <item>Nuh called unto his Lord and said, “My Lord, my son is a
part of my family, and surely Your promise is true, and You are the
greatest of all judges.”</item>
        <item>He said, “O Nuh, in fact, he is not a part of your
family. Indeed, he is (a man of) bad deeds. So do not ask Me something
of which you have no knowledge. I exhort you not to be among the
ignorant.”</item>
        <item>He said, “My Lord, I seek refuge with You that I should
ask You something of which I have no knowledge. If You do not forgive
me and do not show mercy to me, I shall be among the losers.”</item>
        <item>It was said, “O Nuh, disembark in peace from Us and with
blessings upon you and upon the peoples (springing) from those with
you. And there are peoples whom We shall give some enjoyment, then a
painful punishment from Us will visit them.” ¹³</item>
        <item>These are some reports from the unseen (events), which
We reveal to you. You did not know them before this, neither you nor
your people. So, be patient. Surely, the end is in favor of the Godfearing.</item>
        <item>And to ‘Ad, (We sent) their brother Hud. ¹⁴He said, “O my
people, worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. You are nothing
but fabricators.</item>
        <item>O my people, I ask you no reward for it. My reward is
only on the One who created me. Do you, then, not understand?</item>
        <item>O my people, seek forgiveness from your Lord, then turn
to Him in repentance, and He will release the heavens pouring upon
you, and will add strength to your strength, and do not turn away like
sinners.”</item>
        <item>They said, “O Hud, you did not bring to us any proof,
and we are not to leave our gods on your statement, and we are not to
believe in you.</item>
        <item>We do not say except that some of our gods have
subjected you to some evil.” He said, “I make Allah my witness, and
you bear witness that I have nothing to do with what you take as
gods</item>
        <item>Besides Him. So, try your plans against me, all of you
together, then give me no respite.</item>
        <item>I place my trust in Allah who is my Lord and your Lord.
There is no creature but He holds it by the forelock. Surely, my Lord
is on a straight path.</item>
        <item>Now, if you turn away, I have already conveyed to you
the message with which I was sent to you. My Lord will replace you
with some other people, and you cannot do Him any harm. Surely, my
Lord is guardian over every thing.”</item>
        <item>So, when came Our command, We saved Hud and those who
believed along with him, out of mercy from Us, and We did save them
from a heavy punishment.</item>
        <item>Such was the tribe of ‘Ad who rejected the signs of
their Lord, disobeyed their Messengers and followed the dictates of
every obstinate tyrant!</item>
        <item>A curse was made to pursue them in this world and on the
Day of Judgment. Lo! The people of ‘Ad disbelieved their Lord. Lo!
Ruined were ‘Ad, the people of Hud.</item>
        <item>And to (the people of) Thamud (We sent) their brother,
Salih. ¹⁵He said, “O my people, worship Allah. You have no god other
than Him. He has created you from earth and made you settle therein.
So, seek His forgiveness, then turn to Him in repentance. Surely, my
Lord is near, responsive to the prayers.”</item>
        <item>They said, “O Salih, we had hopes in you before this. Do
you ask us not to worship what our fathers used to worship? We have
serious doubts that have disturbed us about the faith to which you are
calling us.”</item>
        <item>He said, “O my people, tell me: If I have a clear proof
from my Lord, and He has bestowed mercy upon me from Himself, who will
come to my help against Allah, if I still disobey Him? So, you extend
nothing to me but loss.</item>
        <item>And O my people, this is the she-camel of Allah, a sign
for you. So, leave her free to eat on the earth of Allah, and do not
even touch her with evil (intention), lest an approaching punishment
should seize you.”</item>
        <item>Then they slaughtered her. So, he said, “Enjoy
yourselves in your homes for three days (only). ¹⁶That is a promise,
not to be backed out.”</item>
        <item>So, when came Our command, We saved Salih and those who
believed along with Him, out of mercy from Us, and (We saved them)
from the disgrace of that day. Surely, your Lord is the Powerful, the
All Mighty.</item>
        <item>And those who transgressed were caught by the Cry, and
they were found dead in their homes, fallen on their knees,</item>
        <item>As though they had never lived there. Lo! The people of
Thamud disbelieved their Lord. Lo! Ruined were the people of Thamud.
</item>
        <item>And Our emissaries came to Ibrahim with the good news.
¹⁷They greeted him with “Salam (peace).” He said, “Salam.” Then he took
not much time in bringing a roasted calf.</item>
        <item>So, when he noticed their hands not acceding to it, he
found them strange and felt scared of them. They said, “Be not scared.
We have been sent to the people of Lut.”</item>
        <item>His wife was standing (nearby), and she laughed. ¹⁸Thus
We gave her the good news about Ishaq, and about Ya‘qub after Ishaq.
</item>
        <item>She said, “Woe to me! ¹⁹ Shall I give birth to a child
while I am an old woman and this is my husband, an old man? This is
something amazing indeed.”</item>
        <item>They said, “Do you marvel at Allah’s command? Allah’s
mercy and His blessings have always been upon you, O people of the
house. Surely, He is Praiseworthy, Glorious.”</item>
        <item>So, when fear left Ibrahim and the happy news came to
him, he started disputing with Us for the people of Lut. ²⁰</item>
        <item>Surely, Ibrahim is forbearing, very penitent, everturning to Allah.</item>
        <item>O Ibrahim! Leave it. In fact, the command of your Lord
has come to pass, and there has to come upon them a punishment that
cannot be averted.”</item>
        <item>When Our emissaries (angels) came to Lut, he was
saddened because of them, and his heart felt uneasy for their sake,
²¹and He said, “This is a very hard day.”</item>
        <item>And his people came to him, rushing upon him. They were
already habitual to commit evil deeds. He said, “These are my
daughters. They are purer for you. ²² so, have fear of Allah and do
not disgrace me in respect of my guests. Is there no reasonable man
among you?”</item>
        <item>They said, “You know that we have no claim on your
daughters, and you know well what we want.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Would that I had some power over you, or could
seek refuge in a strong support!”</item>
        <item>They (the angels) said, “O Lut, we are emissaries of
your Lord. They shall never reach you. So, move with your family in a
part of night, and none of you shall turn to look back; except your
woman. There has to befall her whatever will befall them. ²³Their
deadline is the morning. Is it not that the morning is near?”</item>
        <item>So, when Our command came to pass, We turned their
habitations upside down, ²⁴and rained on it stones of hard clay, one
over another</item>
        <item>Marked from your Lord. And it is not far from the
transgressors. ²⁵</item>
        <item>And to Madyan (We sent) their brother, Shu‘aib. ²⁶He
said, “O my people, worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. And
do not curtail the measure and the weight. I see you quite well off,
and I fear for you the punishment of an encircling day.</item>
        <item>And O my people, perfect the measure and the balance
with justice and do not make the people short of their things, and do
not go about the earth spreading disorder.</item>
        <item>Whatever is allowed by Allah to retain (lawfully) is
better for you, if you are believers. And I am not a watchman over
you.</item>
        <item>They said, “O Shu‘aib, does your Salah (prayer) command
you that we should forsake what our fathers used to worship or that we
should not deal with our wealth as we please? You pretend to be the
only man of wisdom and guidance.”</item>
        <item>He said, “O my people, tell me, if I am on a clear path
from my Lord and He has provided me with a good provision from
Himself, (should I still leave you unguided?) I do not want to do in
your absence what I forbid you from. I want nothing but to set things
right as far as I can. My ability to do any thing comes from none but
Allah. In Him alone I have placed my trust and to Him alone I turn in
humbleness.</item>
        <item>O my people, let not your hostility towards me cause you
to suffer what was suffered by the people of Nuh, or the people of
Hud, or the people of Salih. And the people of Lut are not far from
you.</item>
        <item>Seek forgiveness from your Lord, then turn towards Him
in repentance. Surely, my Lord is very merciful, most loving.”</item>
        <item>They said, “O Shu‘aib, we do not understand much of what
you say, and, in fact, we see you are weak among us. But for your
clan, we would have stoned you. And to us, you are not a man of
respect.”</item>
        <item>He said, “O my people, is my clan more respectable to
you than Allah, as you have taken Him as something thrown behind your
backs? Surely, my Lord encompasses all that you do.</item>
        <item>O my people, do what you can, I am to do (what I can).
Soon you will know the one whom the punishment will visit, putting him
to disgrace, and the one who is false. And wait. I am, with you,
waiting.”</item>
        <item>And when Our command came, We saved Shu‘aib and those
who believed along with him, out of mercy from Us; and those who
transgressed were caught by the Cry, and they were found (dead) in
their homes, fallen on their knees,</item>
        <item>As though they never lived there. Lo! Ruined were
Madyan, like Thamud were ruined.</item>
        <item>And We sent Musa, with Our signs and with clear proof,
</item>
        <item>To Pharaoh and his group. So, they followed the command
of Pharaoh, while the command of Pharaoh was not right.</item>
        <item>He will lead his people on the Day of Judgement, and
make them descend into the Fire. And it is the evil descending place.
</item>
        <item>The curse was made to pursue them here and on the Day of
Judgement. It is the evil reward to be offered.</item>
        <item>That is a part of stories of the towns that We narrate
to you. Some of them are still standing, and (some are) eradicated
like a harvested field. ²⁷</item>
        <item>We did no wrong to them; rather, they have wronged
themselves. So, their gods whom they used to invoke beside Allah did
not come to their help in any way, when came the command of your Lord,
and they added nothing to them except destruction.</item>
        <item>Such is the seizing of your Lord when He seizes the
(people of) towns when they are transgressing. Indeed, His seizing is
painful, severe.</item>
        <item>In this there is a sign for the one who fears the
punishment of the Hereafter. That is a day when all the people shall
be gathered together, and that is a day which will be witnessed by
all.</item>
        <item>We do not defer it but for a limited term.</item>
        <item>The day it comes no one shall speak except by His leave.
So, some of them will be wretched and (some) blessed.</item>
        <item>As for those who are wretched, they shall be in the
Fire. For them there is (nothing but) crying and howling.</item>
        <item>They shall remain there forever, as long as the heavens
and the earth remain intact, ²⁸ unless your Lord wills (otherwise).
²⁹Surely, your Lord does what He intends.</item>
        <item>As for those who are blessed, they shall be in Paradise
living there forever, as long as the heavens and the earth remain
intact, unless your Lord wills (otherwise), It will be an award never
to be ceased.</item>
        <item>So, be not in doubt about what they worship. They
worship only in the way their fathers used to worship earlier. Surely,
We are going to pay them their full share, not curtailed in the least.
</item>
        <item>And We gave Musa the Book, then it was disputed about.
But for a word from your Lord that had already come to pass, the
matter would have been decided between them. Surely, they are in
confounding doubt about it.</item>
        <item>And to all of them, your Lord shall pay for their deeds
in full. Surely, He is aware of all that they do.</item>
        <item>So, stand firm (on faith) as you have been commanded, as
well as those who having repented (from disbelief) have joined you,
and do not cross the limits. Surely, He is watchful of what you do.
</item>
        <item>And do not incline towards the wrongdoers, lest the Fire
should catch you, and you have no supporters other than Allah, then
you should not be helped.</item>
        <item>Establish Salah at both ends of the day, and in the
early hours of the night. Surely, good deeds erase bad deeds. That is
a reminder for the mindful.</item>
        <item>And be patient, for Allah does not let the reward of the
righteous go to waste.</item>
        <item>Then, why is it that there were no people, among the
generations before you, who would have enough remnants of wisdom to
stop others from creating disorder in the land, except a few among
them whom We saved (from Our punishment)? And the wrongdoers pursued
the luxuries they were involved in, and they became sinners.</item>
        <item>Your Lord is not such that He would destroy the towns
unjustly while their people are good in their ways.</item>
        <item>Had your Lord willed, He would have made all the people
a single community. But, they will continue in their differences,
</item>
        <item>Except those whom Allah has blessed with mercy, and for
that He has created them. ³⁰And perfect is the word of your Lord: “I
will surely fill the Hell with Jinns and the human beings, all
together.”</item>
        <item>We narrate to you all such stories from the events of
the messengers as We strengthen your heart therewith. And in these
(stories) there has come to you the truth, a good counsel and a
reminder to those who believe.</item>
        <item>Say to those who do not believe, “Do whatever you can.
We are doing (what we can).</item>
        <item>And wait. We too are waiting.”</item>
        <item>To Allah belong the secrets of the heavens and the
earth, and to Him the entire matter shall be returned. So worship Him
and have trust in Him. Your Lord is not unaware of what you do.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Alif Lam Ra. ¹These are verses of the enlightening Book.
</item>
        <item>We have sent it down, as an Arabic Qur’an, so that you
may understand.</item>
        <item>By revealing this Qur’an to you, we hereby narrate to
you the best narrative, while before this you were among those unaware
(of it).</item>
        <item>It happened) when Yusuf said to his father, “My father,
I saw (in dream) eleven stars and the Sun and the Moon; I saw them all
fallen prostrate before me.’’</item>
        <item>He said, “My son, do not relate your dream to your
brothers, lest they should devise a plan against you. ² Surely, Satan
is an open enemy for mankind.</item>
        <item>And it will be in this way that your Lord will choose
you and teach you the correct interpretation of events, and will
perfect His bounty upon you ³and upon the House of Ya‘qub, as He has
perfected it earlier upon your fore-fathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq.
Surely, your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.”</item>
        <item>Surely, in (the story of) Yusuf and his brothers, there
are signs for those who ask.</item>
        <item>It happened) when they said, “Yusuf and his brother are
dearer to our father than we are, while we are a whole group. Surely,
our father is in clear error.</item>
        <item>Let us kill Yusuf, or throw him at some place on earth,
and thus your father’s full attention will be devoted for you alone,
and after doing that, you may become a righteous people.’’ ⁴</item>
        <item>One of them said, “Do not kill Yusuf; rather, cast him
into the bottom of a pit, so that some wayfarers may pick him up, if
you are going to do something anyway.’’</item>
        <item>They said (to Ya‘qub), “Our father, why is it that you
do not trust us about Yusuf, while we are his well-wishers indeed.
</item>
        <item>Send him with us tomorrow, that he may eat and play, and
of course, we will remain as guards for him.”</item>
        <item>He said, “It makes me sad that you should take him with
you, and I fear that some wolf may eat him up when you are heedless of
him.”</item>
        <item>They said, “If a wolf eats him up, while we are a whole
group, we are then losers indeed.”</item>
        <item>So, when they went away with him and were determined to
put him in the bottom of a pit, (they did accordingly). And We
revealed to him (Yusuf), “You will (one day) remind them of this deed
of theirs, and they will not recognize (you).”</item>
        <item>And at nightfall, they came to their father weeping.
</item>
        <item>They said, “Father, we went racing with one another, and
left Yusuf with our belongings, and the wolf ate him up. You will
never believe us, howsoever truthful we may be.”</item>
        <item>And they came with fake blood on his shirt. He said,
“Rather, your inner desires have tempted you to do something. So,
patience is best. It is Allah whose help is sought against what you
describe.’’</item>
        <item>And some wayfarers came (near the pit in which Yusuf was
thrown), and sent their water-drawer (to bring water for them). So, he
let down his bucket. He said, “What a good news! Here is a boy.” And
they kept him hidden as merchandise, while Allah was aware of what
they were doing.</item>
        <item>And they sold him for a paltry price, for a few silvercoins, and they had not much interest in him.</item>
        <item>And the one who bought him from Egypt said to his wife,
“Make his stay graceful. He may be useful for us. Or, we may adopt him
as a son.” And thus We established Yusuf in the land, so that We
should teach him the interpretation of events. Allah is powerful in
(enforcing) His command, but most of the people do not know.</item>
        <item>And when he reached the prime of his age, We gave him
wisdom and knowledge, and this is how We reward those who are good in
their deeds.</item>
        <item>And she, in whose house he was, seduced him towards
herself, ⁵and bolted the doors, and said, “come on!” He said, “I seek
refuge with Allah. Surely, he (your husband) is my master. He has
given me a good lodging. Indeed, the wrongdoers do not
prosper.”</item>
        <item>She certainly desired him, and he might have desired
her, had he not seen the proof from his Lord. ⁶Thus We did, to turn
evil and lewdness away from him. Surely, he was one of Our chosen
servants.</item>
        <item>They raced towards the door, and she ripped his shirt
from behind, and they found her master by the door. She said, “What
could be the punishment of him who intended evil with your wife,
except that he be imprisoned or (given) a painful
chastisement?”</item>
        <item>He (Yusuf) said, “It was she who tried to seduce me.”
And a witness from her family observed that if his shirt was ripped
from the front side, then she is true and he is a liar;</item>
        <item>And if his shirt was ripped from behind, then she is
telling a lie and he is truthful. ⁷</item>
        <item>So, when he (her husband) saw his shirt ripped from
behind, he said, “This is certainly your trickery, O women. Great is
the trickery of you women indeed.</item>
        <item>O Yusuf, ignore this matter, and you (O woman,) seek
forgiveness for your sin, for you were guilty infact.”</item>
        <item>And women in the city said, “The wife of the minister is
seducing her youthful slave. His love has entered the depth of her
heart. Surely, we see her in open error.”</item>
        <item>So, when she heard of their taunting comments, she
extended an invitation to them and arranged for them a comfortable
place (to sit and dine) and gave everyone a knife, and said (to
Yusuf): “come out to them.” So when they saw him, they found him
great, and (were so stunned that they) cut their hands and said, “Oh
God! He is no human being. He is but a noble angel.”</item>
        <item>She said, “This is the one about whom you reproached me.
Yes, I seduced him, but he abstained. And should he not follow my
command, he shall be imprisoned and will be disgraced.”</item>
        <item>He (Yusuf) said, “My Lord, the prison is dearer to me
than what these women invite me to do. If You do not turn their guile
away from me, I shall get inclined towards them and shall be among the
ignorant.”</item>
        <item>So, his Lord accepted his prayer and turned their guile
away from him. Surely, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Later on, even after having seen the clear signs (of his
innocence), they deemed it proper to imprison him for some time.
⁸</item>
        <item>And two men entered the prison with him. One of them
said, “I have seen myself (in dream) pressing wine.” And the other
said, “I saw myself carrying bread on my head of which the birds were
eating. Let us know its interpretation. We see you are a man of good
deeds.”</item>
        <item>He said, “No food provided for you shall come to you,
but I can give you its description before it comes to you. This is the
knowledge my Lord has given to me. I have abandoned the way of those
who do not believe in Allah, and who are deniers of the Hereafter,
</item>
        <item>And I have followed the way of my fathers, Ibrahim,
Ishaq and Ya‘qub. It is not for us that we associate any partners with
Allah. All this is a part of the favor Allah has bestowed upon us and
upon the people, but most of the people are not grateful. ⁹</item>
        <item>O my fellow prisoners, are different gods better or
Allah, the One, the All-Dominant?</item>
        <item>Whatever you worship, other than Him, are nothing but
names you have coined, you and your fathers. Allah has sent down no
authority for them. Sovereignty belongs to none but Allah. He has
ordained that you shall not worship anyone but Him. This is the only
right path. But most of the people do not know.”</item>
        <item>O my fellow prisoners, one of you will serve wine to his
master, ¹⁰while the other will be crucified and birds will eat from his
head. Destined is the matter you are asking about.”</item>
        <item>And he (Yusuf) said to the one whom he believed likely
to be released out of the two, “Tell your master about me.” ¹¹Then,
the Satan made him forget to tell his master. So, he (Yusuf) remained
in prison for a few years.</item>
        <item>And (one day) the king said (to his courtiers), “I have
seen (in a dream) seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean ones, and
seven ears of grain which are green and (seven) others which are dry.
O people, tell meabout my dream, if you can interpret dreams.”</item>
        <item>They said, “(It seems to be) a mishmash of dreams, and
we do not know the interpretation of dreams.”</item>
        <item>And said the one who was released (from the prison) out
of the two, and recalled (Yusuf) after a long time, “I shall tell you
its interpretation. Just send me (to Yusuf).”</item>
        <item>Thus he came to the prison and said to Yusuf, “Yusuf, O
the truthful one, tell us about seven fat cows eaten by seven lean
ones, and seven ears of grain which are green and (seven) others which
are dry, so that I may go back to the people and they may know (the
interpretation of the dream.)”</item>
        <item>He said, “You will grow crops for seven years
consecutively. So, what you have harvested, leave it in its ear,
except a little which you eat.</item>
        <item>Then seven hard years shall come after that, which shall
eat up what you have stored for them, except a little which you
preserve (to sow).</item>
        <item>Then there shall come after that a year in which people
will have rains and in which they will extract juices.”</item>
        <item>And (when this person went back and told the king about
the interpretation of the dream), the king said, “Bring him to me.”
So, when the messenger came to Yusuf, he said, “Go back to your lord
and ask him, ‘What is the case of the women who cut their hands?’
Surely, my Lord knows well their guile.”</item>
        <item>He (the king) said, “What was your case, O women, when
you seduced Yusuf?” They said, “God forbid, we know of no evil in
him.” The governor’s wife said, “Now the truth has come to light. I
did seduce him, and he is surely truthful.”</item>
        <item>Then Yusuf said), “That was because he (the governor)
may know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that Allah does
not lead the guile of betrayers to success.</item>
        <item>And I do not absolve my inner self of blame. Surely,
man’s inner self often incites to evil, unless my Lord shows mercy.
Certainly, my Lord is the Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.”</item>
        <item>The king said, “Bring him to me, and I shall employ him
purely for myself.” So, when he (the king) talked to him, he said (to
Yusuf), “Today you are with us well-placed, fully trusted.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Appoint me to (supervise) the treasures of the
land. I am indeed a knowledgeable keeper.”</item>
        <item>And thus We gave Yusuf power in the land. He could
settle in it wherever he wished. We extend Our mercy to whomsoever We
will, and We do not let the reward of the righteous people to go to
waste.</item>
        <item>And the reward of the Hereafter is surely better for
those who believe and constantly observe taqwa.</item>
        <item>And came the brothers of Yusuf and appeared before him.
He recognized them, while they did not recognize him. ¹²</item>
        <item>When he equipped them with their provisions, he said,
“Bring to me your other brother from your father’s side. Do you not
see that I give full measure, and I extend the best hospitality?
</item>
        <item>Still, if you do not bring him to me, then you deserve
no (further) measure from me, nor shall you approach me any
more.”</item>
        <item>They said, “We shall persuade his father about him and
we will certainly do it.”</item>
        <item>And he (Yusuf) said to his boys, “Put their goods in
their camel-packs. ¹³Perhaps they will recognize it when they go back
to their family; perhaps they will come again.”</item>
        <item>So, when they returned to their father, they said,
“Father, the (required) measure (of grain) has been withheld from us,
therefore, send our brother with us, so that we may receive our full
measure. And, of course, we are his guards.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Shall I trust you about him as I trusted you
earlier about his brother? Well, Allah is the best guardian, and He is
the Most-Merciful of all the merciful.”</item>
        <item>When they opened their baggage, they found their goods
given back to them. They said, “Our father, what else should we want?
Here is our goods given back to us, and we shall bring food to our
family, protect our brother and add the measure of one camel more.
That is an easy measure.”</item>
        <item>He said, “I shall never send him with you until you give
me a pledge in the name of Allah that you will definitely bring him
back to me, unless you are overpowered (by circumstances).” So, when
they gave him their pledge, he said, “Allah is watchful over what we
say.”</item>
        <item>And he said, “O my sons, do not enter (the city) all of
you from the same gate, rather, enter from different gates. ¹⁴And I
cannot help you in any way against (the will of) Allah. Sovereignty
belongs to none but Allah. In Him I place my trust, and all those who
trust should trust in Him alone.”</item>
        <item>And (recall) when they entered (the city) in the manner
their father had advised them. He could not help them in any way
against (the will of) Allah, but it was just an urge in the heart of
Ya‘qub which he satisfied; he was a man of knowledge, because We had
taught him, but most of the people do not know.</item>
        <item>And when they came to Yusuf, he lodged his brother
(Binyamin) with himself. He said, “Look, I am your brother! So do not
grieve for what they have been doing.”</item>
        <item>Later, when he equipped them with their provisions, he
placed the bowl in the camel-pack of his brother. Then, an announcer
shouted out, “O people of the caravan, you are thieves.”</item>
        <item>Turning towards them, they said, “What are you
missing?”</item>
        <item>They said, “We are missing the measuring-bowl of the
king, and whoever brings it back shall deserve a camel-load, and I
stand surety for it.”</item>
        <item>They said, “We swear by Allah, you know, we did not come
to make mischief in the land, nor have we ever been thieves.”</item>
        <item>They said, “What is the punishment, if you are
liars?”</item>
        <item>They said, “Its punishment? The one in whose saddlebag
it is found shall himself be the punishment. This is how we punish the
wrongdoers.” ¹⁵</item>
        <item>So, he started with their bags before (searching) the
bag of his brother, then, recovered it from the bag of his
brother.This is how We planned for Yusuf. He had no right to take his
brother according to the law of the king, unless Allah so willed. We
elevate in ranks whomsoever We will. Above every man of knowledge,
there is someone more knowledgeable.</item>
        <item>They said, “If he commits theft, (there is nothing
surprising, because) his other brother had committed theft earlier.”
Yusuf kept it (his reaction) to himself and did not reveal it to them.
He said (in his heart), “You are even worse in position. Allah knows
best of what you allege.”</item>
        <item>They said, “O ‘Aziz, ¹⁶ he has a father, a very old man.
So, take one of us in his place. We see you are a generous
man.”</item>
        <item>He said, “We seek Allah’s refuge from keeping anyone
other than him with whom we have found our thing, otherwise we shall
be unjust.”</item>
        <item>So when they lost hope in him, they went aside for
consultation. The oldest of them said, “Do you not know that your
father has taken pledge from you in the name of Allah, while you had
defaulted earlier in the case of Yusuf. So, I shall never leave this
land unless my father permits me or Allah decides about me. He is the
best of all judges.</item>
        <item>Go back to your father and say, ‘Our father, your son
has committed theft, and we do not testify except what we know, and we
could not guard against the unseen.</item>
        <item>Ask (the people of) the town in which we have been, and
the caravan with which we have come, and undoubtedly we are
truthful.”</item>
        <item>He (Ya‘qub) said, “Rather, your inner desires have
seduced you to something. So, patience is best. Hopefully, Allah may
bring them all together. Surely, He is the All-Knowing, AllWise.”</item>
        <item>He turned away from them and said, “How sad I am about
Yusuf!” and his eyes turned white with sorrow and he was suppressing
(his anger and grief).</item>
        <item>They said, “By God, you will not stop remembering Yusuf
until you collapse or perish.”</item>
        <item>He said, “I do not complain of my anguish and sorrow to
anyone but Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know.</item>
        <item>O my sons, go and search for Yusuf and his brother, and
do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah. In fact, only the infidels
lose hope in Allah’s mercy.”</item>
        <item>So, when they came to him (Yusuf), they said, “‘Aziz, we
and our family are struck by distress, and we have brought some goods
of very little worth. So, give us the full measure (of grain) and be
charitable to us. Surely, Allah rewards the charitable.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Do you know what you did to Yusuf and his
brother when you were ignorant?”</item>
        <item>They said, “Is it that you are, in fact, Yusuf?” He
said, “I am Yusuf, and this is my brother. Allah has been very kind to
us. Surely, whoever fears Allah and observes patience, Allah does not
let the reward of such good people to go to waste.”</item>
        <item>They said, “We swear by Allah, indeed Allah has given to
you preference over us, and we were guilty in fact.”</item>
        <item>He said, “No reproach upon you today! May Allah forgive
you, and He is the Most- Merciful of all the merciful.</item>
        <item>Go with this shirt of mine, and put it over the face of
my father, and he will turn into a sighted man. And bring to me all
your family.”</item>
        <item>And when the caravan set out (from Egypt), their father
(Ya‘qub) said (in Canaan), “I sense the fragrance of Yusuf, if you do
not take me to be senile.”</item>
        <item>They said, “By God, you are still in your old
fallacy!”</item>
        <item>So, when came the man with good news, he put it (the
shirt) on his face, and he turned into a sighted man. He (Ya‘qub)
said, “Did I not tell you that I know from Allah what you do not
know?”</item>
        <item>They said, “Our father, pray to Allah to forgive us our
sins. Surely, we have been guilty.”</item>
        <item>He said, “I shall pray to my Lord to forgive you.
Surely, He is the Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.”</item>
        <item>Later, when they came to Yusuf, he placed his parents
near himself and said, “Enter Egypt, God willing, in peace.”</item>
        <item>And he raised his parents up on the throne, and they all
fell before him in prostration. ¹⁷He said, “My father, here is the
fulfillment of my early dream. My Lord has made it come true. He
favored me when he released me from the prison, and brought you from
the countryside after Satan had caused a rift between me and my
brothers. Surely, my Lord does what He wills in a subtle way. Surely,
He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</item>
        <item>My Lord, You have given me power to rule and the
knowledge of interpreting events. O Creator of the heavens and the
Earth, You are my guardian in this world and the Hereafter. Make me
die a Muslim and make me join the righteous.”</item>
        <item>That is a part of the reports of the unseen We reveal to
you (O Prophet). You were not with them when they determined their
object, and when they were planning devices. ¹⁸</item>
        <item>Most of the people are not going to believe despite your
strong desire for it.</item>
        <item>And you do not demand from them any reward against it.
It is nothing but a reminder for all the (people of the) worlds.
</item>
        <item>How many a sign there is in the heavens and the Earth,
which they pass by and they are heedless to them;</item>
        <item>And most of them do not believe in Allah without
associating partners with Him in His divinity.</item>
        <item>Do they feel themselves secure from the visit of Allah’s
encircling punishment or from the sudden arrival of the Hour, while
they are not conscious of it?</item>
        <item>Say, “This is my way. I call (people) to Allah with full
perception, both I and my followers. Pure is Allah; and I am not among
those who associate partners with Allah.”</item>
        <item>We did not send before you (messengers) other than men
from the people of the towns whom We inspired with revelation. Have
they not traveled in the land where they could have seen how was the
fate of those before them? And surely the abode of the Hereafter is
much better for those who fear Allah. Would you, then, still not
understand?</item>
        <item>Punishment was often delayed) until when the messengers
were in despair and thought that they were wrong in their estimation,
Our help came to them, then saved were those whom We willed. And Our
punishment is not averted from the guilty.</item>
        <item>Surely, in the narratives of these, there is a lesson
for the people of understanding. It is not an invented story, rather,
a confirmation of what has been before it, and an elaboration of
everything, and guidance and mercy for a people who believe.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Alif , Lam , Mim , Ra. ¹These are the verses of the
Book. What has been sent down to you from your Lord is true, but most
of the people do not believe.</item>
        <item>Allah is the One who raised the heavens without pillars
that you can see them. Then He positioned Himself on the Throne and
subjugated the sun and the moon, each one of them running to an
appointed time. He manages all matters, elaborating the signs, so that
you may be sure of meeting your Lord.</item>
        <item>He is the One who spread out the earth and made
mountains and rivers on it, and created in it the pairs of two from
all the fruits. He makes the night cover the day. Surely, in that
there are signs for a people who think.</item>
        <item>And in the earth there are tracts of land neighboring
each other, and gardens of grapes, and farms and date palms, some
having twin trunks and some having a single one. (Although) all of
them are irrigated with the same water, We make some of them better
than others in taste. Surely, in that there are signs for a people who
understand.</item>
        <item>If you wonder, then wondrous indeed is their saying, “Is
it that, once we are dust, we are to be created anew?” They are those
who have disbelieved in their Lord, and they are those who (shall)
have shackles around their necks, and they are the people of the Fire.
They shall remain there forever.</item>
        <item>They ask for evil to come sooner than good, ²while
punishments have really come to pass (against people) earlier to them.
And surely, your Lord is the lord of forgiveness for the people
against their wrongdoing, and surely, your Lord is severe in
punishing.</item>
        <item>The disbelievers say, “Why is it that no sign has been
sent down to him from his Lord?” You are but a warner; and for every
people there is a guide.</item>
        <item>Allah knows what every female carries and what the wombs
decrease or increase. ³Everything has measure with Him.</item>
        <item>He is the Knower of the hidden and the manifest. He is
the Great, the High.</item>
        <item>Alike (for Him) is he, from among you, who speaks
quietly and he who speaks aloud, and he who hides in the night and he
who walks out in the day.</item>
        <item>For every one (from among you) there are angels
replacing one another, in front of him and behind him, who guard him
under the command of Allah. ⁴Surely, Allah does not change the
condition of a people unless they change themselves. When Allah
intends evil for a people, there is no way to turn it back, and for
them there is no patron other than Him.</item>
        <item>He is the One who makes you see the lightening in fear
and hope, and who forms the heavy clouds.</item>
        <item>The thunder proclaims His purity with His praise, and
(so do) the angels, out of His awe. And He sends the thunderbolts and
strikes with it whom He wills. They are quarrelling about Allah, and
He is stern in His plan.</item>
        <item>True prayers are to be directed to Him alone; and those
to whom they pray instead of Him do not respond to them at all, but
they are like one who stretches his hands towards water so that it may
reach his mouth (by itself), while it is not to reach it. And the
prayer of the disbelievers (that they make to false gods) is nothing
but straying in void.</item>
        <item>To Allah bow in prostration all who are in the heavens
and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, ⁵and their shadows as well in
morns and eves.</item>
        <item>Say, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?”
Say, “Allah.” Say, “Have you, then, taken as protectors those besides
Him who possess no power to cause benefit or harm even to themselves?”
Say, “Is it that a blind person and a sighted one are equal, or that
all sorts of the darkness and the light are alike?” Or, have they
ascribed such partners with Allah who (according to their belief) have
created (some of the creation) as He has created, and thus the
creation seemed to them alike? Say, “Allah is the Creator of all
things, and He is the One, the All-Dominant.”</item>
        <item>He sent down water from the heavens, so the canals
flowed according to their capacity, and the flood carried bulging
scum. And a similar scum comes up from what they melt in the fire to
obtain ornaments or other objects. This is how Allah depicts the truth
and the untruth. As for the scum, it goes to be thrown away, while
that which benefits people remains on the earth. This is how Allah
brings out the parables. ⁶</item>
        <item>For those who obey their Lord there is the best of
rewards; and those who do not obey Him (shall be in such a plight
that) even if they possess all that is on earth, rather twice as much,
they would offer it in ransom (to redeem themselves from the
punishment). For these there is the worst of reckoning, and their
abode is Hell, which is an evil bed to rest.</item>
        <item>Now, can the one who knows that whatever has been
revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, be equal to one who is
blind? Only the people of understanding respond to the advice -</item>
        <item>Those who fulfill (their) pledge with Allah and do not
break the covenant,</item>
        <item>And those who maintain the relationships Allah has
commanded to be maintained and fear their Lord and are frightful of
evil reckoning,</item>
        <item>And those who observe patience in order to seek the
pleasure of their Lord and establish Salah and spend secretly and
openly from what We have given to them, and repel evil with good.
Those are the ones for whom there is the ultimate abode,</item>
        <item>The eternal gardens they enter, and those as well who
are righteous from their fathers, spouses, and progeny. The angels
will enter onto them from every gate</item>
        <item>Saying) “Peace on you for the patience you observed. So,
how excellent is the ultimate abode.”</item>
        <item>As for those who break their pledge with Allah after it
has been made binding, and cut off the relationships Allah has
commanded to be joined, and make mischief in the land, those are the
ones for whom there is the curse, and for them there is the evil
abode.</item>
        <item>Allah expands the provision for whom He wills and
narrows it (for whom He wills). They are happy with the worldly life,
while the worldly life, compared to the Hereafter, is nothing but a
little enjoyment.</item>
        <item>The disbelievers say, “Why is it that no sign (of their
choice) has been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, “Allah lets go
astray whom He wills and gives guidance to those who turn to Him,
</item>
        <item>The ones who believe and their hearts are peaceful with
the remembrance of Allah. Listen, the hearts find peace only in the
remembrance of Allah.”</item>
        <item>Those who believe and do good deeds, for them there is
the bliss and a good place to return.</item>
        <item>Thus We have sent you, amidst a community before which
many communities have passed away, so that you may recite to them what
We have revealed to you, while they disbelieve in Ar-Rahman (the AllMerciful Allah). ⁷Say, “He is my Lord. There is no god but He. In Him I
place my trust, and to Him is my return.”</item>
        <item>And even if there were a Qur’an wherewith the mountains
could be moved, or the earth could be split apart, or wherewith the
dead are spoken to, ⁸ (they would not believe). In fact, every decision
rests only with Allah. Are the believers not satisfied with the fact
that, if Allah willed, He would have brought all the people to the
right path? ⁹And the disbelievers are continually receiving affliction
because of what they did, or it visits somewhere close to their homes,
until Allah\'s promise will come to pass. ¹⁰ Surely, Allah does not go
back upon His promise.</item>
        <item>Messengers have been mocked at before you, so I let the
disbelievers go on for a while. Then I seized them. So, how was My
punishment?</item>
        <item>Is then He, who is watchful over everyone and over
whatever he does, (equal to their false deities?) Still they have made
partners with Allah. Say, “Give their names. Is it that you are
informing Him of something on earth He does not know, or of just empty
words?” But, their ill- designs have been made alluring for the
disbelievers, and they have been barred from the Path. And for the one
whom Allah deprives of guidance, there is no one to guide.</item>
        <item>For them there is punishment in the worldly life, and
indeed the punishment of the Hereafter is even harder, and for them
there is none to save them from Allah.</item>
        <item>Here is the description of the Paradise promised to the
God-fearing: underneath it the rivers flow; its food is everlasting
and (so is) its shade. This is the ultimate abode of the God-fearing
while the ultimate abode of the disbelievers is Fire.</item>
        <item>Those to whom We have given the Book are happy with what
has been sent down to you ¹¹. And among their groups there are those
who deny some of it. Say, “I am commanded only to worship Allah and
not to ascribe partners to Him. To Him I call and to Him is my
return.”</item>
        <item>Thus We have sent it down, being a command in Arabic.
And if you follow their desires, after the knowledge that has come to
you, there shall be neither a friend for you against Allah, nor a
savior.</item>
        <item>We have sent messengers before you, and gave them wives
and children. It is not for a messenger to bring a verse without the
will of Allah. For every age there are some rules prescribed.</item>
        <item>Allah wipes off what He wills and affirms (what He
wills), and with Him is the Mother Book. ¹²</item>
        <item>And if We show you (O prophet) some of what We have
promised to them, or We take you back to Us (before that), in both
cases you have only to convey the message, and We have to reckon.
¹³</item>
        <item>Have they not seen that We are coming to the land
narrowing it down from all its sides? ¹⁴ Allah judges; there is none to
repel His judgement. And He is swift at reckoning.</item>
        <item>Those before them did devise plans, but all the real
plans belong only to Allah. He knows what every soul earns, and the
disbelievers will soon know for whom is the excellent end.</item>
        <item>The disbelievers say, “You are not a messenger.” Say,
“Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you, and those too
(are my witnesses) who have the knowledge of the Book.” ¹⁵</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Alif, Lam, Ra. ¹This is a book We have sent down to you,
so that you may deliver the people, with the will of their Lord, out
of all sorts of darkness into the light, leading them to the path of
the Almighty, the Praiseworthy</item>
        <item>Allah, the One to whom belongs what is in the heavens
and what is in the earth. Woe be to the disbelievers because of a
severe punishment,</item>
        <item>To those who prefer the worldly life to the Hereafter
and prevent (people) from the way of Allah, and seek to make it
crooked. Those have gone too far in straying.</item>
        <item>We did not send any messenger but (speaking) in the
language of his people, so that he might clearly convey the message to
them. So, Allah lets go astray whom He wills and lets find guidance
whom He wills. And He is the Mighty, the Wise.</item>
        <item>Surely, We sent Musa with Our signs saying to him,
“Bring your people out of (all sorts of) darkness into the light, and
remind them of the Days of Allah. ²Surely, there are signs therein for
every one who observes patience and gratitude.</item>
        <item>And when Musa said to his people, “Remember Allah’s
blessing upon you when He delivered you from Pharaoh’s people who had
been inflicting a grievous torment on you, slaughtering your sons and
leaving your women alive. In that there was a great trial from your
Lord.”</item>
        <item>Recall the time) when your Lord declared, “If you
express gratitude, I shall certainly give you more, and if you are
ungrateful, then My punishment is severe.”</item>
        <item>And Musa said, “If you and all those on earth become
ungrateful, then Allah is free of all needs, worthy of every
praise.”</item>
        <item>Has there not come to you the news of those before you,
the people of Nuh, ‘Ad and Thamud and of those after them. No one
knows them except Allah. ³Their prophets came to them with clear
signs, but they put their hands into their mouths ⁴and said, “We reject
what you are sent with, and indeed we are in confounding doubt about
what you are calling us to believe.”</item>
        <item>Their prophets said, “Is it in Allah that you have some
doubt, who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He calls you,
so that He may forgive you some of your sins and give you respite up
to a specified term.” They said, “You are no more than a human being
like us. You want to prevent us from what our forefathers used to
worship. So, bring us some clear authority.”</item>
        <item>Their prophets said to them, “We are no more than a
human being like you, but Allah bestows His favour upon whom He wills
from among His servants. It is not for us to bring you an authority
without Allah’s permission, and in Allah the believers must place
their trust.</item>
        <item>What is wrong with us that we should not put our trust
in Allah when He has guided us to our paths? We shall, of course,
endure with patience all your persecutions; and all those who have to
trust should trust only in Allah.”</item>
        <item>The disbelievers said to their prophets, “We shall
certainly expel you from our land unless you come back to our faith.”
So, their Lord revealed to them, “We shall destroy the transgressors,
</item>
        <item>And shall certainly let you dwell in the land after
them. This is for the one who is fearful of standing before Me and is
fearful of My warning.”</item>
        <item>They sought final decision (by demanding the divine
scourge), and (thus) every obstinate tyrant failed.</item>
        <item>The Hell is pursuing him, and he shall be made to drink
pus-fluid,</item>
        <item>Which he will arduously sip, and will not be able to
swallow. Death will come upon him from every side, yet he will not
die, and still a heavy chastisement will be ahead of him.</item>
        <item>The deeds of those who refuse to believe in their Lord
are like ashes blown away by the wind on a stormy day. They will not
be able to gain anything out of what they did. That is the farthest
point of straying away from the right path.</item>
        <item>Have you not seen that Allah has created the heavens and
the earth with truth? ⁵If He wills, He can put you away and bring a new
creation;</item>
        <item>And that is not at all difficult for Allah.</item>
        <item>All of them shall appear before Allah. Then, the weak
shall say to the arrogant, “We were your followers. So, can you
relieve us a little from Allah’s punishment?” They will say, “Had
Allah guided us, we would have guided you. It is all the same for us
whether we deplore or endure, we have no way out.”</item>
        <item>The Satan will say when the matter will have been
decided, “Allah promised you a truthful promise while I gave you a
promise and did not fulfill it. I had no authority over you, except
that I invited you and you accepted my call. So, do not blame me, but
blame yourselves. Neither I can come to your help, nor can you come to
my help. I disown your associating me with Allah in the past. Surely,
there is a painful punishment for the unjust.”</item>
        <item>And those who believed and did good deeds shall be
admitted to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, living there forever by
the will of Allah. There they shall greet each other with
“Salam.”</item>
        <item>Have you not seen how Allah has set forth a parable: A
good word is like a good tree, having its root firm and its branches
in the sky.</item>
        <item>It brings its fruits at all times with the will of its
Lord. ⁶Allah sets forth the parables for the people, so that they may
take lesson.</item>
        <item>And the parable of a bad word is like a bad tree,
removed from the top of the soil, having no firm root.</item>
        <item>Allah keeps the believers firm with the stable word in
the worldly life and in the Hereafter; and Allah lets the unjust go
astray; and Allah does what He wills.</item>
        <item>Have you not seen those who adopted disbelief in
exchange of Allah’s favor and caused their people to disembark at a
land of total destruction,</item>
        <item>Which is) the Jahannam. They shall enter it; and it is
an evil place to dwell.</item>
        <item>They have set up partners with Allah, so that they may
mislead (the people) from His path. Say, “Enjoy (for a while). Then
your ultimate journey is to the Fire.”</item>
        <item>Say to My believing servants that they should establish
Salah and spend, secretly and openly, out of what We have given to
them before there comes a day in which there is neither a trade nor
friendship.</item>
        <item>Allah is the One who created the heavens and the earth
and sent down water from the sky, then brought forth with it
sustenance for you from the produce, and subjugated for you the ships,
so that they may sail in the sea with His command, and subjugated for
you the rivers;</item>
        <item>And He subjugated for you the sun and the moon, moving
constantly, and subjugated for you the day and the night,</item>
        <item>And He gave you whatever you asked for. If you (try to)
count the bounties of Allah, you cannot count them all. Indeed, man is
highly unjust, very ungrateful.</item>
        <item>Recall) when Ibrahim said, “My Lord, make this city
peaceful, and keep me and my children away from worshiping idols.
⁷</item>
        <item>My Lord, they have misled many a people. So, the one who
follows me does surely belong to me. As for the one who disobeys me,
then You are Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Our Lord, I have settled some of my children in a valley
of no vegetation, close to Your sanctified House, so that, Our Lord,
they may establish Salah. So, make hearts of people yearn towards
them, and provide them with fruits, so that they may be grateful.
</item>
        <item>Our Lord, surely You know what we conceal and what we
reveal.__Hidden from Allah is nothing whatsoever, neither in the earth
nor in the heavens.__</item>
        <item>Praise be to Allah who, despite my old age, blessed me
with Isma‘il (Ishmael) and Ishaq (Isaac). Surely, my Lord is the One
who listens to the prayer.</item>
        <item>My Lord, make me steadfast in Salah, and my offspring as
well. And, Our Lord, grant my prayer.</item>
        <item>Our Lord, forgive me and my parents and all believers on
the day when reckoning shall take place.”</item>
        <item>Never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers
are doing. He is but giving them respite up to a day when the eyes
shall remain upraised (in terror).</item>
        <item>They shall be rushing with their heads raised upward;
their eyes shall not return towards them ⁸and their hearts shall be
hollow.</item>
        <item>Warn the people of a day when punishment will come upon
them, and the wrongdoers will say, “Our Lord, give us respite for a
short term, and we will respond to Your call and will follow the
messengers.” (Allah will say), “Is it not that you had sworn oaths
earlier that you would not have to leave (the world)?</item>
        <item>And you dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged
themselves, and it became clear to you how We dealt with them, and We
put forth for you the examples.”</item>
        <item>And they worked out their plot and whatever they plot is
before Allah, even though their plot is such as would move the
mountains.</item>
        <item>So, never think that Allah will do against His promise
to His messengers. Surely, Allah is Mighty, the Lord of
Retribution</item>
        <item>The day on which this earth will be turned into some
other earth, and the skies as well, and they all shall appear before
Allah, the One, the All-Dominant.</item>
        <item>On that day you will see the culprits tied up together
in chains,</item>
        <item>Their shirts will be of rosin, ⁹and their faces will be
covered with Fire</item>
        <item>So that Allah repays everyone in full whatever he
earned. Indeed, Allah is swift at reckoning.</item>
        <item>This is a message for mankind, so that they (take lesson
and) be warned, and so that they may know that He is One God, and so
that the people of understanding may observe the advice.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Alif, Lam, Ra. ¹These are verses of the Book and the
enlightening Qur’an.</item>
        <item>On many occasions, the disbelievers will wish that they
were Muslims.</item>
        <item>Let them eat and enjoy, and let (their) fancy make them
neglectful, for they shall soon come to know (their ultimate end).
</item>
        <item>We did not destroy any town without having a predetermined time for it.</item>
        <item>No people can precede their appointed time, nor can they
exceed it.</item>
        <item>They say, “O you to whom the Dhikr (the Qur’an) has been
revealed, you are surely insane.</item>
        <item>Why do you not bring the angels to us, if you are one of
the truthful?”</item>
        <item>We do not send down the angels except with truth, and
then they shall be given no respite. ²</item>
        <item>We, Ourselves, have sent down the Dhikr (the Qur’an),
and We are there to protect it. ³</item>
        <item>We did send the messengers before you among the groups
of earlier peoples.</item>
        <item>No messenger came to them but they used to mock at him.
</item>
        <item>Likewise, We make it (i.e. disbelief) enter into the
hearts of the sinners,</item>
        <item>Whereby) they do not believe in it (the Qur’an), and
this has been the way of earlier people.</item>
        <item>Even if We open a gate in the sky and they keep
ascending through it,</item>
        <item>Still they will say, “In fact our eyes have been
deluded; rather we are enchanted people.</item>
        <item>We have created stellar formations in the sky and have
beautified them for onlookers,</item>
        <item>And have protected them from every outcast devil,</item>
        <item>But the one who tries to eavesdrop is chased by a
clearly visible flame. ⁴</item>
        <item>As for the earth, We have stretched it out and placed on
it firm mountains, and We have caused to grow in it everything wellbalanced,</item>
        <item>And created in it sources of sustenance for you and
those (creatures) for whom you are not the sustainers.</item>
        <item>We have treasures of every thing, but We send it down
only in a determined quantity.</item>
        <item>And We sent forth winds carrying the clouds, then sent
down water from the sky and gave it to you to drink, and you are not
able to store it. ⁵</item>
        <item>It is indeed We, and only We, who give life and bring
death, and We are the ultimate inheritor (of everything).</item>
        <item>We know those of you who went ahead, and We know those
who remained late. ⁶</item>
        <item>Surely, your Lord will gather all of them together.
Indeed He is All-Wise, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Indeed We created man from a ringing clay made of
decayed mud.</item>
        <item>As for the Jann (the first Jinn), We had created him
earlier from the fire of the scorching wind. ⁷</item>
        <item>Recall when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to
create a human being from a ringing clay made of decayed mud.</item>
        <item>When I form him perfect, and blow in him of My spirit,
then you must fall down before him in prostration.”</item>
        <item>So the angels prostrated themselves, all together,
</item>
        <item>Except Iblis (Satan). He refused to join those who
prostrated.</item>
        <item>He (Allah) said, “O Iblis, what is the matter with you
that you did not join those who prostrated?”</item>
        <item>He said, “I am not such that I should prostrate myself
before a mortal whom You have created from a ringing clay made of
decayed mud.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Then, get out of here, for you are an outcast,
</item>
        <item>And upon you is the curse up to the Day of
Judgment.”</item>
        <item>He said, “My Lord, then give me respite up to the day
they (the dead) shall be raised.” ⁸</item>
        <item>He (Allah) said, “Well, respite is given to you</item>
        <item>Till the day of the Appointed Time.”</item>
        <item>He said, “My Lord, since You made me go astray, ⁹I swear
that I shall beautify for them (evils) on the earth, and shall lead
all of them astray,</item>
        <item>Except those of Your servants from among them who are
chosen (by You).”</item>
        <item>He (Allah) said, “This is the straight path leading to
Me (that a person is chosen by Me through his good deeds).</item>
        <item>My servants are such that you have no power over them
except those of the deviators who will follow you.</item>
        <item>And Jahannam (Hell) is the promised place for them all.
</item>
        <item>It has seven gates. For each gate there is a group
apportioned from them.”</item>
        <item>Surely, the God-fearing will be in gardens and streams:
</item>
        <item>Enter here in peace, free of fear.”</item>
        <item>We shall have removed whatever grudge they had in their
hearts, (thus making them) brothers, sitting on couches, face to face.
</item>
        <item>No weariness shall touch them nor will they be expelled
from there.</item>
        <item>Tell My servants that I am the Most-Forgiving, the VeryMerciful</item>
        <item>And that My punishment is the painful punishment,</item>
        <item>And tell them about the guests of Ibrahim. ¹⁰</item>
        <item>When they visited him, they greeted him with Salam
(peace on you). He said, “We are scared of you.” ¹¹</item>
        <item>They said, “Do not be scared. We give you good news of a
boy who will be knowledgeable.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Do you give me the good news despite the old
age has befallen me? So what good news you are giving to me?”</item>
        <item>They said, “We have given to you the good news of a
fact. So do not be one of those who lose hope.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Who can lose hope in the mercy of his Lord
except those who have lost the straight path?”</item>
        <item>He said, “Then, what is your mission, O
messengers?”</item>
        <item>They said, “We have been sent to a sinful people,</item>
        <item>Except the family of Lut - all of whom we shall save,
</item>
        <item>But his wife. We have ordained that she will be among
those who will remain behind.”</item>
        <item>So when the messengers came to the family of Lut,</item>
        <item>He said, “You are an unfamiliar people.” ¹²</item>
        <item>They said, “No, but we have brought to you that
(scourge) in which they have been doubting,</item>
        <item>And we have come to you with a definite matter and
surely we are truthful.</item>
        <item>So, carry your family after a part of the night (has
passed), and follow them at the rear (to make sure that all of your
family has joined you), and no one from you should look back; and keep
going to where you are commanded.”</item>
        <item>We conveyed to him Our decision that they (the
unbelievers) were to be totally uprooted when they would see the
morning.</item>
        <item>And the people of the city came rejoicing.</item>
        <item>He (Lut) said, “They are my guests; so do not put me to
shame,</item>
        <item>And fear Allah and do not disgrace me.”</item>
        <item>They said, “Had we not forbidden you from (being the
guardian of) the whole world?”</item>
        <item>He said, “These are my daughters, if you are to do
something.” ¹³</item>
        <item>By your life, (O prophet) they were wandering blindly in
their intoxication (misguidance).</item>
        <item>So, they were seized by the Cry at sunrise.</item>
        <item>Then, We turned it (the city) upside down and rained
down upon them stones of baked clay.</item>
        <item>Surely, in that there are signs for those who read
signs.</item>
        <item>Surely, it (their city) is located on the straight road.
</item>
        <item>Surely, in it there is a sign for the believers.</item>
        <item>And the people of Aikah were (also) transgressors.
</item>
        <item>So, We punished them in retribution, and both of them
are (situated) by a highway, clearly visible. ¹⁴</item>
        <item>And the people of Al-Hijr ¹⁵gave the lie to the
messengers.</item>
        <item>We provided them with Our signs, yet they kept turning
away from them.</item>
        <item>They used to hew out houses from the hills peacefully.
</item>
        <item>Then, the Cry seized them by the morning.</item>
        <item>So, whatever they earned did not come to their help.
</item>
        <item>We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that
is in between them without a truthful purpose. The Hour is sure to
come. Therefore, overlook (their evil behavior) in a gracious manner.
</item>
        <item>Surely, your Lord is the Creator of all, the AllKnowing.</item>
        <item>We have given you the seven oft-repeated verses ¹⁶and the
glorious Qur’an.</item>
        <item>Never stretch your eyes towards what We have given to
groups of them to enjoy, and do not grieve for them, and be kind to
believers in humbleness,</item>
        <item>And say, “I am a plain warner indeed”</item>
        <item>To warn them that We may send down the scourge upon
them) as We sent down upon the dividers</item>
        <item>Who had split the divine recitation (Scriptures) into
bits. ¹⁷</item>
        <item>So, by your Lord, We shall question all of them</item>
        <item>About what they have been doing.</item>
        <item>Now, proclaim what you are commanded to, ¹⁸and turn away
from those who ascribe partners to Allah.</item>
        <item>Surely, We are sufficient for you against those who
deride,</item>
        <item>Those who believe in any other god along with Allah. So,
they shall soon learn (the reality).</item>
        <item>We know that your heart feels distressed for what they
say.</item>
        <item>So, proclaim the purity and glory of your Lord, and be
among those who prostrate themselves (before Allah);</item>
        <item>And worship your Lord until comes to you that which is
certain.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Allah’s command has (almost) come. So, do not demand
that it should come sooner. ¹Pure is He, and much higher than their
ascribing partners to Him.</item>
        <item>He sends down the angels at His behest with the spirit,
(that is, the revelation), upon whom He wills from among His servants:
“Warn people that there is no god but Me. So, fear Me.”</item>
        <item>He created the heavens and the earth in the proper way.
He is much higher than their ascribing partners to Him.</item>
        <item>He created man from a drop, and soon he turned into a
debating person, expressing himself openly.</item>
        <item>He has created cattle in which there is warmth and other
benefits for you; and from them you have food;</item>
        <item>And in them there is a beautiful look for you when you
drive them home in the evening and take them out to graze.</item>
        <item>And they carry your loads to a city where you were not
able to reach without putting yourselves to arduous labor. Surely,
your Lord is Very-Kind, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>And (He created) horses, mules and donkeys, so that you
may ride on them, and they may give you a good look. And He creates
what you do not know (as yet). ²</item>
        <item>Undertaken by Allah is (to show) the right path, while
there are some (paths) that are crooked. Had He so willed, He would
have led all of you to the right path. ³</item>
        <item>He is the One who sent down water from the heavens, of
which you have your drink; and with it (you grow) plants on which you
pasture your cattle.</item>
        <item>He causes the crops therewith to grow for you, and
olives, and date palms, and grape vines, and all the fruits. Surely,
in that, there is a sign for a people who ponder.</item>
        <item>He has subjugated for you the day and the night and the
sun and the moon, and the stars (too) are subservient by His command.
Surely, in that, there are signs for a people who understand.</item>
        <item>And (He subjugated to you) whatever He created for you
on the earth having varied colors. Surely, in that, there is a sign
for a people who accept advice.</item>
        <item>He is the One who has subjugated the sea, so that you
may eat fresh meat from it, and may take out from it ornaments you
wear, and you see the boats cleaving through it, and so that you may
seek His bounty, ⁴and that you may be grateful.</item>
        <item>And He placed mountains on the earth, lest it should
shake with you, and rivers and tracks, so that you may find the right
way,</item>
        <item>And He has set landmarks. And by the stars they find the
right way.</item>
        <item>Is then the One who creates (everything) equal to one
who does not create? Would you still pay no heed?</item>
        <item>If you count the bounties of Allah, you cannot count
them all. Surely, Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Allah knows what you conceal and what you reveal.</item>
        <item>Those whom they invoke beside Allah do not create any
thing; rather they are themselves created;</item>
        <item>They are dead, having no life, and they do not know when
they shall be raised again. ⁵</item>
        <item>Your God is One God. As for those who do not believe in
the Hereafter, their hearts are defiant and they are arrogant.</item>
        <item>Invariably, Allah knows what they conceal and what they
reveal. Surely, He does not like the arrogant.</item>
        <item>When it is said to them, “What has your Lord sent down?”
They say, “It is nothing but the tales of the ancient people.”</item>
        <item>Hence, they shall bear the full weight of their burdens
on the Day of Judgment, and also some of the burdens of those whom
they mislead without knowledge. Remember, evil is the burden they
bear.</item>
        <item>Those (too) who were before them made plots. Then (the
command of) Allah came upon their buildings (uprooting them) from the
foundations. So roofs fell down upon them from above, and the
chastisement came to them from where they could not even imagine.
</item>
        <item>Then, on the Day of Judgment, He will put them to
disgrace and will say, “Where are My partners for whose sake you used
to quarrel (with the believers)?” Those endowed with knowledge will
say, “Today, the disgrace and the evil (chastisement) has to befall
the unbelievers,</item>
        <item>The ones to whom the angels brought death while they
were (still) wronging themselves.” Then, they will resort to
submission, (yet will say), “We used to do nothing wrong.” (They will
be answered) Why not? Allah knows well what you used to do.</item>
        <item>Hence, enter the gates of Jahannam to live in it
forever. So evil is the abode of the arrogant.</item>
        <item>And (on the other hand,) it is said to the God-fearing,
“What has your Lord sent down?” They say, “(He has sent down)
excellent (discourse).” For those who do good, there is good (end) in
this world, and indeed the abode of the Hereafter is much better.
Excellent is the abode of the God-fearing -</item>
        <item>The eternal gardens they enter, with rivers flowing
beneath them. For them there is what they desire. That is how Allah
rewards the God-fearing -</item>
        <item>The ones to whom angels bring death while they are pure
(in beliefs and deeds). They (angels) say, “Peace on you! Enter
Paradise for the deeds you have been doing.”</item>
        <item>They (the unbelievers) are waiting for nothing but that
the angels should come to them, or comes the command of your Lord.
Similar was the reaction of those who were before them. Allah did not
wrong them; rather they were doing wrong to themselves.</item>
        <item>So, the evils of what they did overtook them, and they
were encircled by the very thing they used to ridicule.</item>
        <item>The polytheists said, “If Allah had so willed, we would
have not worshipped anything other than Him - neither we nor our
forefathers - nor would we have made anything unlawful without (a
command from) Him.” Similar was the reaction of those who were before
them. Therefore, the messengers’ obligation is no more than to convey
the message clearly.</item>
        <item>We did raise a messenger among every people, with the
message: “Worship Allah and stay away from the Rebel (the Satan).”
Then, there were some among them whom Allah guided, and there were
others against whom deviation (from the right path) was established.
So, travel on earth and see how was the fate of those who rejected
(the prophets).</item>
        <item>If you are keen for their guidance, then, (remember
that) Allah does not lead those to the right path whom He lets go
astray, and for them there are no helpers.</item>
        <item>They swore by Allah on solemn oaths: “Allah will not
resurrect those who die.” Why not? It is a promise on His part, which
is due to come true, but most of the people do not know.</item>
        <item>He will resurrect all of them,) so that He discloses for
them what they have been disputing about, and so that those who
disbelieve may know that they were liars.</item>
        <item>Whenever We intend to do something, We do no more than
say to it, “Be,” and it comes to be.</item>
        <item>Those who have migrated for the sake of Allah after they
were oppressed, We shall give them a good place in the world, ⁶and of
course, the reward of the Hereafter is much greater, if they only
knew!</item>
        <item>Those who kept patient, and who place trust in their
Lord.</item>
        <item>We did not send (messengers) before you other than men
whom We inspired with revelation. So, ask the people (having the
knowledge) of the Reminder (the earlier Scriptures), if you do not
know.</item>
        <item>We sent them) with clear signs and scriptures. ⁷And We
sent down the Reminder (The Qur’an) to you, so that you explain to the
people what has been revealed for them, and so that they may ponder.
⁸</item>
        <item>Do those who contrive evil plots feel immune from that
Allah makes them sink into the earth, or from that the punishment
comes to them from where they would not perceive,</item>
        <item>Or that He seizes them when roaming about - while they
are not able to frustrate Him -</item>
        <item>Or that He seizes them while they are in apprehension?
So, indeed your Lord is Very-Kind, Very-Merciful. ⁹</item>
        <item>Have they not observed the things Allah has created,
their shadows inclining from the right and the left prostrating
themselves before Allah, while they are humble? ¹⁰</item>
        <item>To Allah prostrates itselfwhatever there is in the
heavens and whatever there is in the earth, and the angels, and they
show no arrogance.</item>
        <item>They fear their Lord above them and do as they are
commanded.</item>
        <item>¹¹Allah has said, “Do not take two gods. He is but One
God. So, Me alone you fear.”</item>
        <item>And to Him belongs what is in the heavens and the earth,
and it is only He who deserves obedience as ever due. Would you, then,
fear someone other than Allah?</item>
        <item>Whatever blessing you have is from Allah. Then, once you
are touched by distress, to Him alone you cry for help.</item>
        <item>Then, as soon as He removes the distress from you, a
group from among you starts ascribing partners to their Lord.</item>
        <item>Thus, they deny what We have given to them. Well, enjoy
yourself (for some time), and soon you will come to know (the fate of
your misdeeds).</item>
        <item>They allocate a share from what We have given to them
for those (idols) the reality of whom they do not even know. ¹² By
Allah, you shall definitely be responsible for the fabrications you
have been inventing.</item>
        <item>They ascribe daughters to Allah - Pure is He - and for
themselves is what they desire! ¹³</item>
        <item>When one of them is given the good news of a female
child, his face becomes gloomy and he is choked with grief.</item>
        <item>He hides himself from people because of the (selfpresumed) bad news given to him (and wonders): Shall he keep it
despite the disgrace (he will face in the society), or put it away
into the dust? In fact, evil is what they decide.</item>
        <item>Those who do not believe in the Hereafter have evil
attributes, and to Allah belong the most exalted attributes. He is the
Mighty, the Wise.</item>
        <item>If Allah were to seize the people for their
transgression, He would have spared no creature on earth, but He lets
them go on up to an appointed time. So, when their time will come,
they will not be able to delay it for a moment, nor to bring it soon.
</item>
        <item>They assign to Allah what they themselves dislike, and
their tongues make the false statement that for them there is a happy
end. No, Fire is imminently theirs, and they are being driven (towards
it) speedily.</item>
        <item>By Allah, We sent (messengers) to communities before
you, but the Satan made their deeds look good to them. So, he is their
patron today, and for them there is a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>We have sent down the Book to you, only because you may
explain to them what they differed about, and (so that it may be)
guidance and mercy for a people who believe.</item>
        <item>Allah sent down water from the heavens and revived the
land with it after it was dead. Surely, in that there is a sign for a
people who listen. ¹⁴</item>
        <item>Surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle. We
provide you, out of what lies in their bellies between feces and
blood, the (drink of) milk, pure and pleasant for those who drink.
</item>
        <item>And from the fruits of date palms and grape vines, you
obtain intoxicants, and good provision. ¹⁵Surely, in that there is a
sign for a people who understand.</item>
        <item>Your Lord revealed to the honeybee: “Make homes in the
mountains, in the trees and in the structures they raise.</item>
        <item>Then, eat from all the fruits, and go along the pathways
of your Lord made easy for you.” From their bellies comes out a drink
of various colors in which there is cure for people. Surely, in that
there is a sign for a people who ponder.</item>
        <item>Allah has created you, then He takes you back. And among
you there is one who is carried to the worst part of the age, so that
he knows nothing after having knowledge. ¹⁶Surely, Allah is AllKnowing, All-Powerful.</item>
        <item>Allah has given some of you preference over others in
provision. So, those given preference are not willing to pass on their
provision to their slaves, so that they become equal in it: Do they,
then, reject the blessing of Allah? ¹⁷</item>
        <item>Allah has created spouses from among you and created
sons and grandsons for you from your spouses, and gave you provision
from good things. Is it, then, the falsehood that they believe in, and
the blessing of Allah that they reject?</item>
        <item>They worship, besides Allah, the objects that have no
power to give them anything from the heavens and the earth, nor can
they ever have such power.</item>
        <item>So, do not coin similarities for Allah. Surely, Allah
knows and you do not know.</item>
        <item>Allah gives an example: There is a slave owned (by
someone), who has no power over anything, and there is a person whom
We have given good provision from Us, and he spends out of it secretly
and openly. Are they equal? Praise be to Allah. But, most of them do
not know.</item>
        <item>And Allah gives another example: There are two men. One
of them is dumb who is unable to do anything, and he is a burden on
his master. Wherever he directs him to, he brings no good. Can he be
equal to the one who enjoins justice and is on the straight path?
</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the
earth; and the matter of Hour (of Judgment) is no more than of
twinkling of the eye, or even quicker. ¹⁸Of course, Allah is powerful
over everything.</item>
        <item>Allah has brought you forth from your mothers’ wombs
when you knew nothing, and He made for you ears, eyes and hearts, so
that you may be grateful.</item>
        <item>Did they not look at the birds how they are controlled
in the atmosphere of the sky? No one holds them but Allah. Surely, in
that there are signs for a people who believe.</item>
        <item>Allah has made your houses a place of comfort for you,
and made for you houses from the hides of cattle, which you find so
light on the day you travel and the day you camp, and out of their
wool and their fur and their hair (He created) furnishings and goods
of enjoyment for a period of time.</item>
        <item>Allah has made for your benefit shades from what He has
created, and made for you shelters in the mountains, and made for you
shirts that protect you from heat, and shirts that protect you in your
battles. This is how He perfects His favor upon you, so that you may
submit.</item>
        <item>If they still turn away, then, your responsibility is
only to convey the message clearly.</item>
        <item>They are aware of Allah’s favor, yet they deny it, and
most of them are ungrateful.</item>
        <item>Remember) the Day on which We shall raise up a witness
from every people, then the disbelievers will not be allowed (to make
excuses), nor shall they be asked to repent.</item>
        <item>And when the unjust will see the punishment, it will not
be lightened for them, nor will they be given respite.</item>
        <item>When the Mushriks (i.e. those who ascribe partners to
Allah) will see those whom they made partners with Allah, they will
say: “Our Lord, these are the partners we made whom we called in
worship besides you.” Then, they (the partners) will turn to them
saying: “You are indeed liars.” ¹⁹</item>
        <item>On that day they will tender submission to Allah, and
all that they used to fabricate will have vanished from them.</item>
        <item>For those who disbelieve and put obstructions in the way
of Allah, We shall add up punishment after punishment for the mischief
they used to make.</item>
        <item>And (think of) the day We shall send to every people a
witness from among them (to testify) against them, and We shall bring
you (O prophet) as witness against these. And We have revealed to you
the Book, an exposition of everything, and guidance, and mercy, and
glad tidings for the Muslims.</item>
        <item>Allah enjoins to do justice and to adopt good behavior
and to give relatives (their due rights), and forbids shameful acts,
evil deeds and oppressive attitude. He exhorts you, so that you may be
mindful.</item>
        <item>Fulfill the Covenant of Allah when you pledge, and do
not break oaths after you swear them solemnly, while you have made
Allah a witness over you. Surely, Allah knows all that you do.</item>
        <item>Do not be like the woman who had broken her yarn into
pieces after spinning it firmly, ²⁰by taking your oaths as means of
mischief between yourselves, merely because a group gets greater
benefit than the other. In fact, Allah puts you to a test thereby and,
of course, on the Day of Resurrection He will explain to you all those
matters in which you disagreed.</item>
        <item>If Allah so willed, He would have made all of you a
single community, ²¹but He lets whom He wills go astray and takes whom
He wills to the right path; and surely you will be questioned about
what you used to do.</item>
        <item>Do not make your oaths a means of mischief among
yourselves, lest a foot should slip after it is firmly placed, ²²and
you taste evil consequences for your having prevented (others) from
the path of Allah, and you incur a great punishment.</item>
        <item>And do not take a paltry price against the pledge of
Allah. Indeed, what is with Allah is much better for you, if you only
knew.</item>
        <item>What is with you shall perish and what is with Allah
shall last. And certainly, We shall bless those who observed patience,
with their reward for the best of what they used to do.</item>
        <item>Whoever, male or female, has acted righteously, while
being a believer, We shall certainly make him live a good life, and
shall give such people their reward for the best of what they used to
do.</item>
        <item>So, when you recite the Qur’an, seek refuge with Allah
against Satan, the accursed.</item>
        <item>He is such that he has no authority over those who
believe and place trust in their Lord.</item>
        <item>His authority is only over those who befriend him and
those who associate partners with Allah.</item>
        <item>Whenever We replace a verse with another verse - and
Allah knows well what He reveals - they say, “You are but a forger.”
The fact rather is that most of them are ignorant. ²³</item>
        <item>Say, “This has been brought down by Ruh-ul-Qudus (the
Holy Spirit - Jibra’il ) from your Lord rightly (as due), so that it
may bring firmness to the believers and become guidance and good news
for the Muslims.</item>
        <item>We know well that they say, “There is a man who teaches
him.” The language of the one they refer to is non-Arabic while this
is clear Arabic language. ²⁴</item>
        <item>Surely, those who do not believe in Allah’s verses,
Allah does not lead them to the right path, and for them there is a
painful punishment.</item>
        <item>It is (not the Prophet but) the disbelievers in Allah’s
verses who forge lies, and it is they who are the liars.</item>
        <item>Whoever rejects his faith in Allah after having believed
in Him - not the one who is compelled (to utter a word of disbelief)
under duress while his heart is at peace with Faith, but the one who
has laid his breast wide open for disbelief - upon such people is the
wrath of Allah, and for them there is a heavy punishment.</item>
        <item>That is because they have preferred the worldly life to
the Hereafter, and that Allah does not lead the disbelieving people to
the right path.</item>
        <item>Those are the ones Allah has set a seal on whose hearts,
ears and eyes; and they are the heedless.</item>
        <item>Invariably, they are the losers in the Hereafter.</item>
        <item>Then, your Lord - for those who left their homes after
being persecuted, then fought in the way of Allah and stood patient -
surely your Lord is, after all that, Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.
</item>
        <item>All this will happen) on the day when everyone will come
pleading for himself, and everyone will be given in full what he did,
and they will not be wronged.</item>
        <item>Allah gives an example: There was a town, secure and
content with its sustenance coming in plenty from every place. Then,
it turned ungrateful to the bounties of Allah; so, Allah made it to
taste hunger and terror (that covered it) like a garment, as
recompense of what its people used to do.</item>
        <item>And, of course, a messenger from among themselves had
come to them, but they rejected him; so the punishment seized them
when they were wrongdoers.</item>
        <item>So, eat the permissible and pure things from what Allah
has provided you, and be grateful for the bounty of Allah, if you
worship Him alone.</item>
        <item>He has but prohibited for you the carrion, the blood,
the flesh of swine and what has been invoked upon with a name other
than that of Allah. However, if anyone is compelled by necessity -
neither seeking pleasure, nor crossing the limit (of necessity) -
then, Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful. ²⁵</item>
        <item>Do not say about what your tongues describe falsely,
“This is lawful and that is unlawful” so that you may forge the lie
upon Allah. Surely, those who forge a lie upon Allah do not prosper.
</item>
        <item>Let there be) a little enjoyment, and (then) for them
there is a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>For those who are Jews, We had prohibited that which We
have already told you; ²⁶and We did not wrong them, but it was they who
used to wrong themselves.</item>
        <item>Then your Lord - for those who did evil because of
ignorance, then repented after that and corrected themselves - surely
your Lord is, after all that, Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Surely, Ibrahim was an Ummah (a whole community in
himself), devoted to Allah, a man of pure faith; and he was not among
the Mushriks (i.e. those who associate partners with Allah)</item>
        <item>He was grateful to His bounties. He (Allah) chose him
and led him to the straight path.</item>
        <item>We bestowed good upon him in this world; and in the
Hereafter, he is among the righteous.</item>
        <item>Then, We revealed to you, “Follow the way of Ibrahim,
the upright, and he was not among the Mushriks”.</item>
        <item>The Sabbath was prescribed only for those people (i.e.
Jews) who differed in it, and your Lord will certainly judge between
them on the Day of Resurrection in those matters in which they used to
differ. ²⁷</item>
        <item>Invite (people) to the way of your Lord with wisdom and
good counsel. And argue with them in the best of manners. Surely, your
Lord knows best the one who deviates from His way, and He knows best
the ones who are on the right path.</item>
        <item>And if you were to harm (them) in retaliation, harm them
to the measure you were harmed. ²⁸And if you opt for patience, it is
definitely much better for those who are patient.</item>
        <item>And be patient. Your patience is bestowed by none but
Allah, and do not grieve over them, and do not be in distress for what
they devise. ²⁹</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah is with those who fear Him and those who
are good in their deeds.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Glorious is He Who made his servant travel by night from
Al-Masjid-ul-Haram to Al-Masjid-ul-Aqsa whose environs We have
blessed, so that We let him see some of Our signs. ¹Surely, He is the
All-Hearing, the All- Seeing.</item>
        <item>And We gave Musa the Book and made it guidance for the
children of Isra’il (bearing the command) “Do not take anyone other
than Me as guardian,</item>
        <item>O you, the progeny of those whom We put on board with
Nuh. Surely, He was a very grateful servant.”</item>
        <item>And We declared to the children of Isra’il in the Book:
“You will surely spread mischief on the earth twice, and you will
surely show utmost haughtiness.</item>
        <item>So, when came the time appointed for the first of the
two, We dispatched against you some servants belonging to us ²having
strong aggressive power, who combed through the houses; and it was a
promise, bound to be fulfilled. ³</item>
        <item>Then We gave you your turn to overpower them, and
increased your strength with wealth and sons, and made you greater in
number,</item>
        <item>Saying) ‘If you do good, you will do it for your own
benefit, and if you do evil, it will be against yourselves’. Later,
when came the time appointed for the second, (We sent others,) so that
they spoil your faces, and so that they enter into the Mosque as the
former ones entered it the first time, and utterly destroy whatever
they prevail upon.</item>
        <item>May be your Lord would bestow mercy upon you. But if you
do this again, We shall do that again, ⁴and We have made Jahannam
(Hell) a prison for the disbelievers.”</item>
        <item>Surely, this Qur’an guides to something that is most
straightforward, and gives glad tidings to the believers who do good
deeds that ready for them there is a great reward,</item>
        <item>And that We have prepared a painful punishment for those
who do not believe in the Hereafter.</item>
        <item>Man prays for evil like his prayer for good, and man is
so hasty. ⁵</item>
        <item>We have made the night and the day two signs, then We
made the sign of night marked by darkness and the sign of day bright,
so that you may seek grace from your Lord, and that you may know how
to number the years and how to compute, and We have expounded
everything in detail.</item>
        <item>We have tied up every human’s fortune to his neck, ⁶and
on the Day of Resurrection, We will bring forth a book for him that he
will find wide open,</item>
        <item>And We will say to him) “Read your book. Enough are you
today to take your own account.”</item>
        <item>Whoever adopts the right path does so for his own
benefit, and whoever goes astray does so to his own detriment, and no
bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another, and it is not Our
way to punish (anyone) unless We send a Messenger.</item>
        <item>And when We intend to destroy a habitation, We command
its affluent people (to do good), then they commit sins therein, and
thus the word (of punishment) becomes applicable to it (habitation),
and We annihilate it totally.</item>
        <item>How many a generation have We destroyed after Nuh! And
enough is your Lord to know, (and) watch the sins of His servants.
</item>
        <item>Whoever opts for the immediate (benefits from) life
herein, We give him, right here in this life, as much as We will, to
whomever We intend. Then We assign Jahannam for him where he shall
enter condemned, discarded.</item>
        <item>And whoever opts for the Hereafter and makes efforts for
it as due, while he is a believer, then, the effort of such people is
appreciated! ⁷</item>
        <item>To all of them - both these and those - We extend the
grants of your Lord. And the grant of your Lord is not barred (for
anyone). ⁸</item>
        <item>See how We made some of them excel some others (in this
world) and, of course, the Hereafter is much higher in ranks and much
greater in degrees of merit.</item>
        <item>Do not set up any other god along with Allah, otherwise
you will sit condemned, forsaken.</item>
        <item>Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and
do good to parents. If any one of them or both of them reach old age,
do not say to them: uff (a word or expression of anger or contempt)
and do not scold them, and address them with respectful words,</item>
        <item>And submit yourself before them in humility out of
compassion, and say, “My Lord, be merciful to them as they have
brought me up in my childhood.”</item>
        <item>Your Lord knows best what is in your hearts. If you are
righteous, then He is Most-Forgiving for those who turn to Him in
repentance.</item>
        <item>Give the relative his right, and the needy and the
wayfarer. And do not squander recklessly.</item>
        <item>Surely, squanderers are brothers of satans, and the
Satan is very ungrateful to his Lord.</item>
        <item>And if you turn away from them looking for a bounty from
your Lord you are expecting, then speak to them in polite words.
⁹</item>
        <item>And do not keep your hand tied to your neck, nor extend
it to the full extent, lest you should be sitting reproached, emptyhanded. ¹⁰</item>
        <item>Indeed, your Lord expands sustenance for whomsoever He
wills, and constricts (for whomsoever He wills). Surely, He is AllAware of His servants, All-Seeing.</item>
        <item>Do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We
provide sustenance to them and to you, too. Killing them is a great
sin indeed.</item>
        <item>Do not even go close to fornication. It is indeed a
shameful act, and an evil way to follow.</item>
        <item>Do not kill any person the life of whom is sanctified by
Allah, except for a just reason. And whoever is killed unjustly, We
have invested his heir with authority (of equal retaliation), but he
must not cross the limit in the matter of killing. ¹¹Surely, he will
be helped.</item>
        <item>Do not go near the property of an orphan, except in a
manner that is good, until he comes to his maturity. And fulfill the
covenant. Surely, the covenant shall be asked about (on the Day of
Reckoning).</item>
        <item>And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a
straight balance. That is fair, and better at the end.</item>
        <item>And do not follow a thing about which you have no
knowledge. Surely, the ear, the eye and the heart - each one of them
shall be interrogated about. ¹²</item>
        <item>Do not walk on the earth in haughty style. You can
neither tear the earth apart, nor can you match the mountains in
height.</item>
        <item>That which is evil, of all these, is detestable in the
sight of your Lord.</item>
        <item>This is part of the Wisdom your Lord has revealed to
you. And do not set up any other god along with Allah, lest you should
be thrown into Jahannam , reproached, rejected.</item>
        <item>Is it, then, that your Lord has chosen you people to
have sons, and has Himself opted for females from among the angels?
¹³Surely, you are uttering a serious statement.</item>
        <item>Surely, We have explained things in various ways in this
Qur’an, so that they may pay heed to the advice; but it increases
nothing in them except aversion.</item>
        <item>Say, “Had there been other gods along with Him”, as they
say, “then they would have found out a way to the Lord of the Throne”.
¹⁴</item>
        <item>Pure is He, and Exalted, immensely above what they say.
</item>
        <item>All the seven skies and the earth and all those therein
extol His purity. And there is not a single thing that does not extol
His purity along with His praise, but you do not understand their
extolling. Surely He is Forbearing, Most-Forgiving.</item>
        <item>When you recite the Qur’an, We place an invisible
curtain between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter,
</item>
        <item>And We put covers on their hearts barring them from
understanding it, and (We put) deafness in their ears; and when you
refer to your Lord alone (without referring to their presumed
deities,) in the Qur’an, they turn their backs in aversion.</item>
        <item>We are fully aware of the reason for which they listen,
¹⁵when they listen to you, and when they are in secret consultation:
when the transgressors say, “You are following none but a bewitched
man.”</item>
        <item>See how they have made (silly) statements about you; so
they have gone astray and cannot find a way.</item>
        <item>And they say, “Once we are reduced to bones and dust, is
it then that we will be raised, created anew?”</item>
        <item>Say, “Be you stones or iron</item>
        <item>Or any creation you deem harder in your hearts.”
Thereupon they will ask, “Who will bring us back?” Say, “The One who
created you for the first time.” So, they will shake their heads
before you and say, “When shall that be?” Say, “May be, it is
near.”</item>
        <item>It will be) on a day when He will call you, and you will
respond praising Him, and you will think you did not stay (on the
earth) but for a short while.</item>
        <item>Tell My servants that they should speak that which is
best. Surely, Satan creates discord among them. Indeed, Satan is an
open enemy to mankind.</item>
        <item>Your Lord knows you best. If He so wills, He will have
mercy on you, and if He so wills, He will punish you, and We did not
send you (O Prophet,) to become responsible for them.</item>
        <item>Your Lord knows best about all those in the heavens and
the earth, and We have certainly granted excellence to some prophets
over some others, and We gave Dawud the Zabur (the Psalms).</item>
        <item>Say, “Call those whom you assume (to be gods), besides
Him, while they have no power to remove distress from you, nor to
change it.”</item>
        <item>Those whom they invoke, do themselves seek the means of
access to their Lord as to which of them becomes the closest, and they
hope for His Mercy and fear His punishment. The punishment of your
Lord is really something to be feared.</item>
        <item>There is no town but We are to destroy it before the
Doomsday, or punish it with severe punishment. ¹⁶That is what stands
written in the Book.</item>
        <item>Nothing made us refrain from sending the signs (demanded
by the pagans,) except that the earlier people had rejected them. (For
example,) We gave Thamud the she-camel, as an eye-opener, then they
did wrong to her, ¹⁷and We do not send signs but as a warning.</item>
        <item>Remember) when We said to you that your Lord encompasses
all humans. And We did not make the vision We showed to you, but a
test for the people - and the tree cursed in the Qur’an as well. ¹⁸And
We warn them, yet it adds nothing to them but enormous rebellion.
</item>
        <item>Remember) when We said to the angels, “Prostrate
yourself before ’Adam.” So, they all prostrated, except Iblis (Satan).
He said, “Shall I prostrate before the one You have created from
mud?”</item>
        <item>He (Iblis) added, “Tell me, this one whom You have
honored more than me, if You give me respite till the Doomsday, I will
subdue his progeny, except a few of them.”</item>
        <item>He (Allah) said, “Go then, for whoever of them follows
you, the Hell shall be the recompense of you all, a full recompense.
</item>
        <item>Entice with your voice those of them whom you can, and
rally against them your horsemen and your footmen, and share with them
in their wealth and their children, and make promises to them” - and
Satan promises them nothing but delusion -</item>
        <item>As for My servants, you have no control over them, and
your Lord is enough to look after (everything).”</item>
        <item>Your Lord is the One who causes ships to sail for you
through the sea, so that you may go in quest of His bounty; surely, He
is Ever-Merciful for you.</item>
        <item>And when you face a hardship at sea, vanished are those
whom you used to invoke, except Him (Allah). Then, once He brings you
safe to the land, you turn away (from Him); man is so ungrateful.
</item>
        <item>Do you, then, feel secure from that He makes a part of
the land sink down along with you, or that He sends down a rain of
stones on you, whereupon you will find no one to protect you?</item>
        <item>Or, do you feel secure from that He takes you back to it
(the sea) once again, and sends a heavy storm of wind upon you which
drowns you because of your disbelief, and then you will find no one to
help?</item>
        <item>And We bestowed dignity on the children of ’Adam and
provided them with rides on the land and in the sea, and provided them
with a variety of good things and made them much superior to many of
those whom We have created.</item>
        <item>Think of) the Day when We will call every people with
their books of deeds. Then the ones who will be given their book in
their right hands will read their book (happily) and will not be
wronged even to the measure of a fine thread.</item>
        <item>But whoever is (too) blind in this (world to see the
right path) will be (too) blind in the Hereafter (to reach the
salvation), and much more astray from the path. ¹⁹</item>
        <item>O Prophet,) Surely, they were about to lure you away
from what We have revealed to you, so that you forge something else
against Us, and in that case they would have certainly made you a
bosom friend.</item>
        <item>Had We not made you firm, it was likely that you would
have inclined towards them a little bit.</item>
        <item>In that case, We would have surely made you taste a
double (punishment) in life and a double (punishment) after death,
then you would not have found anyone to help you against Us. ²⁰</item>
        <item>And they were likely to harass you in the land, so that
they could expel you from there, and in that case, they will have not
lived (there) after you, but a little. ²¹</item>
        <item>Such has been Our way with the messengers We sent before
you. And you will find no change in Our way.</item>
        <item>O Prophet,) establish Salah between the decline of the
sun and the darkness of the night, and (establish) the recital at
dawn. ²²Surely, the recital at dawn is well attended.</item>
        <item>And during the night, wake up for Salah of tahajjud , an
additional prayer for you. It is very likely that your Lord will place
you at Praised Station. ²³</item>
        <item>And say, “O my Lord, make me enter a rightful entrance
and make me exit a rightful exit, and grant me from Your Own a power,
favored (by You).”</item>
        <item>And say, “Truth has come and falsehood has vanished.
Falsehood is surely bound to vanish.” ²⁴</item>
        <item>We reveal the Qur’an, which is cure and mercy for the
believers; and it adds nothing to the unjust but loss.</item>
        <item>When We bestow Our favor upon man, he avoids (to
recognize it) and keeps himself far aside (from obedience), and when
some evil touches him, he is in total despair.</item>
        <item>Say, “Everyone acts in his own style. So, your Lord
knows best which one is better guided in his way.”</item>
        <item>And they ask you about the soul. Say, “The soul is
something from the command of my Lord, and you are not given from the
knowledge but a little.” ²⁵</item>
        <item>And if We so will, We will surely take away what We have
revealed to you, then you shall find no one to rely upon against Us in
this matter. ²⁶</item>
        <item>But it is a mercy from your Lord. Great is indeed His
favor upon you.</item>
        <item>Say, “If all the humans and jinns join together to
produce anything like this Qur’an, they will not (be able to) come up
with anything like it, even if they assist one another. ²⁷</item>
        <item>Indeed We explained every subject in this Qur’an in
various ways for the benefit of mankind. Still, most of the people
refused to do anything but reject.</item>
        <item>They said, “We shall never believe in you unless you
cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth.</item>
        <item>Or you have a garden of date palms and grapes, then you
bring forth rivers from their midst in abundance.</item>
        <item>Or you cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces, as you
claimed, or you bring Allah and angels beforeus face to face.</item>
        <item>Or you have a house made of gold. Or you ascend to the
sky, and we will not believe in your ascension unless you send down to
us a book we may read.” Say, “I proclaim the Purity of my Lord. I am
nothing but human, a messenger.”</item>
        <item>Nothing prevented people from believing, when guidance
came to them, except that they said, “Has Allah sent a man as a
messenger?”</item>
        <item>Say, “Had there been angels (living) on the earth,
walking about in peace, We would have certainly sent down to them an
angel from the heavens as a messenger.” ²⁸</item>
        <item>Say, “Allah is sufficient as witness between me and you.
Surely, He is All-Aware, All-Watchful to His servants.”</item>
        <item>The one whom Allah guides is the guided one; and those
whom He lets go astray, you will never find for them any helpers other
than Him. And We shall gather them on the Day of Judgment, with their
faces down-blind, dumb and deaf. Their abode is the Fire. Whenever it
calms down, We increase its flames for them.</item>
        <item>That is their punishment, because they rejected Our
signs and said, “Is it that once we are reduced to bones and dust, is
it then that we shall be raised, created anew?”</item>
        <item>Have they not seen that Allah who has created the
heavens and the earth has the power to create them as they were? He
has appointed a time for them in which there is no doubt. Still, the
wrongdoers refused to do anything but reject.</item>
        <item>Say, “If you were to own the treasures of my Lord’s
blessing, you would certainly hold them back, lest it should be spent.
²⁹Man is so niggardly.”</item>
        <item>Surely We gave Musa nine clear signs. ³⁰ so, ask the
children of Isra’il, when he came to them, Pharaoh said to him, “I am
afraid, O Musa, you are under the spell of magic.”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “You know well that these (signs) are
sent down by none but by the Lord of the heavens and the earth as eyeopeners. And, I am afraid O Pharaoh, you are going tobe
destroyed.”</item>
        <item>Then he (Pharaoh) tried to harass them to drivethem out
of the land, so We drowned him and those with him altogether,</item>
        <item>And thereafter We said to the children of Isra’il, “Live
in the land. So, when the appointed time of the Hereafter will come,
We shall bring you all joined together.”</item>
        <item>With truth We have sent it (the Qur’an) down and with
truth it descended, and We did not send you but as a bearer of good
tidings and as a warner.</item>
        <item>We have divided the Qur’an in portions, so that you may
recite it to the people gradually, and We have revealed it little by
little.</item>
        <item>Say, “Believe in it or do not believe in it; when it is
recited to those who were given knowledge before it, they fall down on
their facesin prostration</item>
        <item>³¹and say, “Pure is our Lord. Certainly, the word of our
Lord was sure to be fulfilled.”</item>
        <item>They fall down on their faces weeping, and it increases
humbleness in their hearts.</item>
        <item>Say, “Call (Him by the name of) Allah or Ar-Rahman, ³²in
whichever way you call, His are the Best Names.” Do not be (too) loud
in your Salah, nor be (too) low in it, and seek a way in between.
</item>
        <item>Say, “Praise belongs to Allah who has neither had a son,
nor is there any partner to Him in His kingdom, nor is anyone (needed)
to protect Him from (any) weakness. And proclaim His greatness, an
open proclamation.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Praise belongs to Allah who has sent down the Book to
His servant, and allowed no crookedness in it,</item>
        <item>A straightforward Book to warn of a severe punishment
from Him, and to give the good news to the believers, who do righteous
deeds, that they will have an excellent reward (Paradise)</item>
        <item>In which they will dwell for ever,</item>
        <item>And to warn those who have said that Allah has had a
son,</item>
        <item>While they have no knowledge about it, nor had their
fathers. Grave is the word that comes out of their mouths. They say
nothing but lie.</item>
        <item>So, (O Prophet) perhaps you are going to kill yourself
after them, out of grief, if they do not believe in this discourse.
</item>
        <item>Surely, We have made what is on earth an adornment for
it, so that We test them as to who among them is better in deeds.
</item>
        <item>And surely, We are going to turn whatever is thereon
into a barren land.</item>
        <item>Do you think that the People of Kahf (the Cave) ¹and
Raqim ²(inscription) were unusual out of Our signs?</item>
        <item>When the young men took refuge in the Cave and said,
“Our Lord, bless us with mercy from Your own and provide us with
guidance in our matters.”</item>
        <item>So, We sealed up their hearing (putting them to sleep)
in the Cave for a number of years.</item>
        <item>Thereafter We raised them up, so that We know which of
the two groups ³had better calculated the period in which they
remained (sleeping).</item>
        <item>We narrate to you their story with truth. They were
young men who believed in their Lord and We gave them more guidance.
</item>
        <item>We made their hearts firm when they stood up and said,
“Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We shall never
invoke any god other than Him, otherwise we would be saying something
far from the truth.</item>
        <item>These, our people, have adopted gods other than Him. Why
do they not bring a clear proof in their favor? So, who is more unjust
than the one who fabricates a lie against Allah?</item>
        <item>When you have turned away from them, and those whom they
worship, except Allah, then seek refuge in the cave, and your Lord
will extend His mercy for you, and provide you ease in your
matters.”</item>
        <item>You would see the sun, when it rose, turning away from
their Cave towards the right; and when it set, it bypassed them
towards the left, and they were (lying) in the hollow thereof. ⁴That is
one of the signs of Allah. Whomsoever Allah guides is the one who gets
the right path and whomsoever He lets go astray, for him you will find
no one to help, no one to lead.</item>
        <item>And you would think they were awake while they were
asleep. We turned them on their sides, right and left. And their dog
had its forelegsstretched out to the doorstep. If you had a look at
them, you would have fled away from them and would have been filled
with awe of them.</item>
        <item>In this way We raised them up until they asked each
other. One of them said, “How long did you tarry?” They said, “A day,
or part of a day.” They said, “Your Lord knows best how long you
tarried.” So, send one of you with this silver (coin) of yours to the
city and let him look around which of the eatables are the purest and
let him bring you some foodfrom there. And he must act in polite
manner, and must not let anyone know about you.</item>
        <item>If they (the habitants of the city) will know about you,
they will stone you or force you to revert to their faith, and in that
case, you will never find success.”</item>
        <item>And in this way, We made them known to the people (of
the city), so that they realize that Allah’s promise is true, and that
there is no doubt about the Hour (the Day of Resurrection). ⁵When they
were disputing among themselves in their matter, they said, “Erect a
building over them. Their Lord knows them best.” Said those who
prevailed in their matter, “We will certainly make a mosque over
them.”</item>
        <item>Some will say, “(They were) three, the fourth of them
being their dog,” and some will say, “Five, the sixth of them being
their dog, just making conjectures.” And others will say, “Seven, the
eighth of them is their dog.” Say, “My Lord knows best about their
number.” No one knows them except a few, so do not argue about them
except an apparent argumentation. And do not ask anyone of these about
them. ⁶</item>
        <item>And never say about anything, “I will do this
tomorrow,”</item>
        <item>Unless (you say - ‘if) Allah wills.’ And remember your
Lord if you forget, ⁷and say (to those who asked you about the story of
the People of the Cave), “May be, my Lord will lead me to something
closer than this to guidance.”</item>
        <item>They stayed in their Cave for three hundred years and
added nine.</item>
        <item>Say, “Allah knows best how long they stayed. To Him
belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth - how well He sees and
how well He hears! They have no supporter other than Him and He lets
no one share His authority.”</item>
        <item>And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of
your Lord. There is no one to change His words, and you will never
find a refuge beside Him.</item>
        <item>Keep yourself content with those who call their Lord
morning and evening, seeking His pleasure, ⁸and let not your eyes
overlook them, seeking the splendor of the worldly life. And do not
obey the one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, and
who has followed his desire and whose behavior has exceeded the
limits.</item>
        <item>And say, “The truth is from your Lord. Now, whoever so
wills may believe and whoever so wills may deny.” Surely, We have
prepared for the unjust a fire, whose tent will envelop them. And if
they will beg for help, they shall be helped with water like oily
dregs that will scald the faces. Vile is the drink, and evil is the
Fire as a resting-place.</item>
        <item>As for those who believe and do righteous deeds,__of
course, We do not waste the reward of those who are good in deeds.
</item>
        <item>Those are the ones for whom there are eternal gardens,
rivers flowing beneath them. They will be adorned therein with
bracelets of gold, and they will be dressed in green garments, made of
fine silk and thick silk, reclining therein on couches. Excellent is
the reward and beautiful is the Paradise as a resting-place.</item>
        <item>Give them an example. There were two men; We gave one of
them two gardens of grapes, and surrounded both of them with datepalms, and placed vegetation between them.</item>
        <item>Both the gardens brought forth their fruit, and
suppressed nothing from it, and We caused a stream to flow through
them.</item>
        <item>And he had wealth. So, he said to his companion while
conversing with him, “I am greater than you in wealth and stronger in
manpower.”</item>
        <item>And he entered his garden while he was doing wrong to
himself. He said, “I do not think that this will ever perish,</item>
        <item>And Ido not think that the Hour (Day of Judgment) has to
come. And even if I am sent back to my Lord, I will surely find a
better place than this to resort to.”</item>
        <item>Said his companion to him, as he was conversing with
him, “Do you deny Him who created you from dust, then from a drop (of
semen), then He made you a perfect man?</item>
        <item>As for me, I believe that Allah is my Lord, and I do not
associate anyone with my Lord.</item>
        <item>Why, when you entered your garden, did you not say,
‘(Everything is) as Allah wills. There is no power except with Allah’?
If you see me inferior to you in wealth and children,</item>
        <item>Then, it is likely that my Lord will give me (what is)
better than your garden, and will send to it a punishment from the
heavens, and it will become a barren land.</item>
        <item>Or, its water will sink deep in the earth, so that you
will never be able to search it out.”</item>
        <item>And its produce was overwhelmed by calamities and he
stood wringing his hands (in anguish) over what he had invested in it,
while it was fallen down on its trellises and he was saying, “I wish I
had not ascribed any partner to my Lord!”</item>
        <item>There were no supporters for him beside Allah, who could
come to his help, nor was he able to defend himself.</item>
        <item>That is where the power of protection rests with Allah,
the True God. He is the best in rewarding and best in requiting.
</item>
        <item>Give them the example of the worldly life; it is like
water We sent down from the sky, then the vegetation of the earth was
mingled with it, and then it turned into chaff that is blown by the
winds, and Allah is powerful over everything.</item>
        <item>Wealth and children are the embellishment of the worldly
life, and the everlasting virtues are better with your Lord, both in
rewards and in creating good hopes.</item>
        <item>And (visualize) the Day when We will make mountains
move, and you will see the earth fully exposed, and We shall gather
them together, so as not to leave a single one of them.</item>
        <item>And they shall be presented lined-up before your Lord.
(It will be said to them,) “Lo! You have come to Us just as We had
created you for the first time, while you claimed that We would not
make any appointed time for you.”</item>
        <item>And the book (of deeds) will be placed (before them),
then you will see the guilty people scared of its contents and saying,
“Woe to us! What a book is this! It has missed nothing, minor or
major, but has taken it into account.” Thus they will find whatever
they did present before them, and your Lord will not wrong anyone.
</item>
        <item>Recall) when We said to the angels, “Prostrate
yourselves before ’Adam.” So, they prostrated themselves, all of them
but Iblis (Satan). He was of the Jinn, so he rebelled against the
command of his Lord. Do you still take him and his progeny as friends
instead of Me, while they are enemy to you? Evil is he as substitute
(of obedience to Allah) for wrongdoers.</item>
        <item>I did not make them witnesses of the creation of the
heavens and the earth, nor of their own creation. I was not such that
I should take the misleaders as helpers. ⁹</item>
        <item>Recall) the Day when He will say, “Call My ‘partners’
whom you claimed as such.” So, they will call them, but they will not
respond to them, and We will put a destructive barrier between them.
</item>
        <item>And the sinners will see the Fire; so they will know
that they will have to fall into it, and they will find no way to
bypass it.</item>
        <item>Indeed We have explained in this Qur’an every subject in
various ways for the benefit of the people, but out of all creation,
man is most disputing.</item>
        <item>The only thing that prevented people from believing,
even after the guidance had come to them, and from seeking forgiveness
from their Lord, is (their demand) that what used to come to the
earlier people should come to them as well, or that the punishment
should visit them face to face. ¹⁰</item>
        <item>We send the messengers only as bearers of good tidings
and warnings, and those who disbelieve raise disputes on the basis of
the false (arguments), so that they may nullify the truth with it; and
they have taken My signs, and the warnings given to them, as mockery.
</item>
        <item>Who is more unjust than the one who was reminded through
the signs of his Lord, but he turned away from them, and forgot what
his own hands sent ahead. Indeed We have put covers on their hearts
that bar them from understanding it, and (We have created) deafness in
their ears. And if you call them to guidance, even then they will
never adopt the right path.</item>
        <item>Your Lord is the Most Forgiving, the Lord of Mercy. If
He seizes them for what they did, He may cause the punishment to
befall them sooner, but there is an appointed time for them, from
which they can never find a place of refuge.</item>
        <item>These are the towns that We destroyed when they (i.e.
their people) transgressed, and We had appointed a time for their
destruction.</item>
        <item>Recall) when Musa said to his young man, “I shall not
give up until I reach the meeting point of the two seas, or else I
shall go on traveling for years.” ¹¹</item>
        <item>So, when they reached the meeting point of the two seas,
they forgot their fish, and it made its way into the sea as in a
tunnel.</item>
        <item>When they went further, he said to his young man, “Bring
us our morning meal; we have, indeed, had much fatigue from this
journey of ours.”</item>
        <item>He said, “You see, when we stayed at the rock, I forgot
the fish. It was none but Satan who made me forget it to tell you
about it - and it made its way into the sea in an amazing
manner.”</item>
        <item>He said, “That was what we were looking for.” ¹²So they
returned, retracing their footsteps.</item>
        <item>Then they found one of Our servants whom We blessed with
mercy from Us and whom We gave knowledge, a knowledge from Our own.
¹³</item>
        <item>Musa said to him, “May I have your company so that you
teach me some of the rightful knowledge you have been given.”</item>
        <item>He said, “You can never bear with me patiently.</item>
        <item>And how would you keep patient over something your
comprehension cannot grasp?”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “You will find me patient, if Allah
wills, and I shall not disobey any order from you.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Well, if you follow me, do not ask me about
anything unless I myself start telling you about it.”</item>
        <item>So, they both moved ahead, until when they boarded a
boat, he sliced it (by removing one of its planks). He (Musa) said,
“Did you slice it to drown its people? In fact, you have done a
terrible act.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Did I not say that you can never bear with me
patiently?”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “Do not hold me punishable for what I
forgot, and do not make my course too difficult for me.”</item>
        <item>So, they moved ahead until when they met a boy, he
killed him (the boy). He (Musa) said, “Did you kill an innocent soul
while he did not kill anyone? You have committed a heinous act
indeed.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Did I not tell you that you can never bear
with me patiently?”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “If I ask you about something after
this, do not allow me your company. You have now reached a point where
you have a valid excuse (to part with me) from my own side. “</item>
        <item>Then, they moved ahead until they came to the people of
a town; they asked its people for food, and they refused to host them.
Then, they found there a wall tending to fall down. So he (Khadir) set
it right. He (Musa) said, “If you wished, you could have charged a fee
for this.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Here is the point of parting ways between me
and you. I shall now explain to you the reality of things about which
you could not remain patient.</item>
        <item>As for the boat, it belonged to some poor people who
worked at sea. So I wanted to make it defective, as there was a king
across them who used to usurp every boat by force.</item>
        <item>As for the boy, his parents were believers. We
apprehended that he would impose rebellion and infidelity upon them.
</item>
        <item>We, therefore, wished that their Lord would replace him
with someone better than him in piety, and more akin to affection.
</item>
        <item>As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the
city, and there was a treasure beneath it belonging to them, and their
father was a pious man. So your Lord willed that they should reach
their maturity and dig out their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord.
I did not do it on my own accord. This is the reality of things about
which you could not remain patient.” ¹⁴</item>
        <item>They ask you about Dhul-Qarnain. ¹⁵ say, “I shall now
recite to you an account of him.”</item>
        <item>Surely, We gave him power on earth and gave him means to
(have) everything (he needs).</item>
        <item>So he followed a course,</item>
        <item>Until when he reached the point of sunset, he found it
setting into a miry spring, ¹⁶and found a people near it. We said, “O
Dhul-Qarnain, either punish them or adopt good behavior with them.”
¹⁷</item>
        <item>He said, “As for him who does wrong, we shall punish
him, then he will be sent back to his Lord, and He will punish him
with a severe punishment.</item>
        <item>As for the one who believes and acts righteously, he
will have the best (life) as reward, and we shall speak to him
politely in our directions.”</item>
        <item>Thereafter, he followed a course,</item>
        <item>Until when he reached the point of sunrise, he found it
rising over a people for whom We did not make any shelter against it.
¹⁸</item>
        <item>Thus it was, and Our knowledge fully comprehends
whatever (wealth and equipment) he had with him.</item>
        <item>Thereafter he followed a course</item>
        <item>Until when he reached between the two mountains, he
found by them a people who were almost unable to understand anything
said.</item>
        <item>They said, “O Dhul-Qarnain, the (tribes of) Ya’juj and
Ma’juj (Gog and Magog) are mischief-makers on the earth. ¹⁹So, should
we assign a tax for you on condition that you make a barrier between
us and them?”</item>
        <item>He said, “What my Lord has (already) given in my control
is better enough (for me than the tax you are offering to me), so help
me (only) with some (man) power, and I shall make a rampart between
you and them.</item>
        <item>Bring me big pieces of iron.” (They proceeded
accordingly) until when he leveled up (the gap) between the two
cliffs, he said, “Blow.” (They complied) until when he made it (like)
fire, he said, “Bring me molten copper, and I will pour it upon
this.”</item>
        <item>So they (Ya’juj and Ma’juj) were not able to climb it,
nor were they able to make a hole in it.</item>
        <item>He said, “This is a mercy from my Lord. Then, when the
promise of my Lord will come, He will make it leveled to the ground.
²⁰The promise of my Lord is true.”</item>
        <item>And on that day, (i.e. the Doomsday) We will leave them
(all the people including Ya’juj and Ma’juj) surging over one another.
And the Horn shall be blown, then We shall gather them together.
</item>
        <item>And on that day We will bring Jahannam fully exposed
before the infidels</item>
        <item>Whose eyes were under a cover against My reminders, and
they were not able to listen.</item>
        <item>Do, then, the disbelievers deem (it fit) that they take
My servants as patrons beside Me? Surely, We have prepared Jahannam as
entertainment for the disbelievers.</item>
        <item>Say, “Shall We tell you about the greatest losers in
respect of (their) deeds?</item>
        <item>Those are the ones whose effort in the worldly life has
gone in vain, while they think they are doing well.</item>
        <item>Those are the ones who rejected the signs of their Lord
and (the concept of) meeting with Him, so their deeds have gone to
waste, and We shall assign to them no weight at all.</item>
        <item>That is their punishment, the Jahannam , for they
disbelieved and made My signs and My messengers a mockery.</item>
        <item>Surely those who believed and did righteous deeds,
theirs are the Gardens of Firdaus as entertainment</item>
        <item>Where they will live forever, and will not wish to move
from there.”</item>
        <item>Say, “If the ocean were to be ink for (writing) the
Words of my Lord, ²¹the ocean would have been consumed before the
Words of my Lord are exhausted, even though we were to bring another
(ocean) like it in addition.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Surely, I am but a human being like you; it is
revealed to me that your God is the One God. So the one who hopes to
meet his Lord must do righteous deed and must not associate anyone in
the worship of his Lord.”</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Kaf, Ha Ya, ‘Ain, Sad ¹</item>
        <item>This is a narration of your Lord’s mercy to His servant
Zakariyya,</item>
        <item>When he called his Lord in a low voice.</item>
        <item>He said, “My Lord, I am in a state that bones in my body
have turned feeble, and the head has flared up grey with old age, and
I never remained, My Lord, unanswered in my prayer to You.</item>
        <item>I fear (my) kinsmen after me, ² and my wife is barren,
so bless me with an heir, from Your own side,</item>
        <item>Who inherits me and inherits the house of Ya‘qub. And
make him, My Lord, a favourite one.”</item>
        <item>Allah said) “O Zakariyya, We give you the good news of a
boy whose name is Yahya. We did not create any one before him of the
same name.”</item>
        <item>He Said, “My Lord, how shall there be a boy for me while
my wife is barren, and I have reached the extreme of old age?”</item>
        <item>He said, “So it is; your Lord said ‘it is easy for Me,
and I did create you before, when you were nothing.’”</item>
        <item>He said, “My Lord, make for me a sign.” He said, “Your
sign is that you will not (be able to) speak to the people for three
(consecutive) nights, even though you will be sound in health.”</item>
        <item>Then he came out to his people from the place of prayer,
and directed them by gestures to proclaim the purity of Allah at
morning and evening. ³</item>
        <item>When the child was born, Allah said to him,) “O Yahya,
hold on to the Book firmly.” And We gave him wisdom, while he was
still a child,</item>
        <item>And (blessed him with) love from our own, and purity;
and he was God-fearing,</item>
        <item>And he was good to his parents; and he was not
oppressive (or) disobedient.</item>
        <item>Peace on him the day he was born, the day he dies and
the day he will be raised alive.</item>
        <item>And mention in the Book (the story of) Maryam, when she
secluded herself from her people to a place towards East,</item>
        <item>Then she used a barrier to hide herself from them. Then,
We sent to her Our Spirit, (Jibra’il) and he took before her the form
of a perfect human being.</item>
        <item>She said, “I seek refuge with the All-Merciful (Allah)
against you, if you are God-fearing.” ⁴</item>
        <item>He said, “I am but a message-bearer of your Lord (sent)
to give you a boy, purified.”</item>
        <item>She said, “How shall I have a boy while no human has
ever touched me, nor have I ever been unchaste?”</item>
        <item>He said, “So it is; your Lord said, ‘It is easy for Me,
and (We will do this) so that We make it a sign for people and a mercy
from Us, and this is a matter already destined.’”</item>
        <item>So she conceived him, and went in seclusion with him to
a remote place.</item>
        <item>Then the labour pains brought her to the trunk of a
palm-tree. She said “O that I would have died before this, and would
have been something gone, forgotten.”</item>
        <item>Then he called her from beneath her: ⁵“Do not grieve;
your Lord has placed a stream beneath you.</item>
        <item>Shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards yourself and,
it will drop upon you ripe fresh dates.</item>
        <item>So eat, drink and cool your eyes. Then if you see any
human being, say (to him), “I have vowed a fast (of silence) for the
All-Merciful (Allah,) and therefore, I shall never speak to any human
today.”</item>
        <item>Then she came to her people carrying him (the baby).
They said, “O Maryam you have committed something grave indeed.</item>
        <item>O sister of Harun, ⁶ neither your father was a man of
evil nor was your mother unchaste.”</item>
        <item>So, she pointed towards him (the baby). They said, “How
shall we speak to someone who is still a child in the cradle?”</item>
        <item>Spoke he (the baby), “Verily I am the servant of Allah.
He has given me the Book, and made me a prophet,</item>
        <item>And He has made me a blessed one wherever I be, and has
enjoined Salah and Zakah upon me as long as I am alive,</item>
        <item>And (He has made me) good to my mother, and he did not
make me oppressive (or) ill-fated.</item>
        <item>And peace is upon me the day I was born, the day I shall
die, and the day I shall be raised alive again.”</item>
        <item>That is ‘Isa, the son of Maryam, to say the truth in
which they (Christians) are disputing.</item>
        <item>It is not for Allah to have a son. Pure is He. When He
decides a thing, He simply says to it, “Be” and it comes to be.</item>
        <item>And (O Prophet, say to the people,) “Allah is surely my
Lord and your Lord. So, worship Him. This is the straight
path.”</item>
        <item>Then the groups among them fell in dispute. ⁷So, how evil
is the fate of the disbelievers when they have to face the Great Day.
</item>
        <item>How strong will their hearing be, and how strong their
vision, the day they will come to Us! But today the transgressors are
straying in clear error.</item>
        <item>Warn them of The Day of Remorse when the whole thing
will be settled, while they are heedless and do not believe.</item>
        <item>Surely We, only We, shall be the ultimate owner of the
earth and all those on it, and to Us they will be returned.</item>
        <item>And mention in the Book (the story of) Ibrahim. Indeed,
he was Siddiq (a man of truth), a prophet,</item>
        <item>When he said to his father, “My dear father, why do you
worship something that does neither hear nor see, nor help you in any
way?</item>
        <item>My dear father, indeed there has come to me a knowledge
that has not come to you; so, follow me, and I shall lead you to a
straight path.</item>
        <item>My dear father, do not worship the Satan. The Satan is
surely rebellious to the All-Merciful, (Allah).</item>
        <item>My dear father, I fear lest a punishment from the AllMerciful (Allah) should afflict you, and you become a companion of
Satan.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Are you averse to my gods O Ibrahim? Should
you not stop, I will definitely stone you. And leave me for
good.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Peace on you. I shall seek forgiveness for you
from my Lord. He has always been gracious to me.</item>
        <item>And I go away from you and what you invoke besides
Allah. And I shall invoke my Lord. Hopefully I shall not be a looser
by invoking my Lord.”</item>
        <item>So, when he went away from them and what they worshipped
besides Allah, We blessed him with Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya‘qub (Jacob)
and We made each one of them a prophet,</item>
        <item>And We bestowed on them (a great deal) of our mercy, and
caused them to have a good name at a high level.</item>
        <item>And mention in the Book (the story of) Musa. Indeed he
was a chosen one and was a messenger, a prophet.</item>
        <item>And We called him from the right side of the mount Tur
(Sinai), and We brought him close to communicate in secret.</item>
        <item>And, out of Our mercy, We granted him his brother Harun
as a prophet.</item>
        <item>And mention in the Book (the story of) Isma‘il. He was
indeed true to his promise, and was a messenger, a prophet.</item>
        <item>He used to enjoin Salah and Zakah upon his family, and
was favourite to his Lord.</item>
        <item>And mention in the Book (the story of) Idris. He was
indeed a Siddiq (man of truth), a prophet.</item>
        <item>We raised him to a high place.</item>
        <item>Those are the people whom Allah has blessed with
bounties, the prophets from the progeny of ’Adam, and of those whom We
caused to board (the Ark) along with Nuh, and from the progeny of
Ibrahim and Isra’il (Jacob), and from those whom We guided and
selected. When the verses of The Rahman (The All-Merciful) were
recited before them, they used to fall down in Sajdah (prostration),
while they were weeping.</item>
        <item>⁸Then came after them the successors who neglected Salah
and followed (their selfish) desires. So they will soon face (the
outcome of their) deviation,</item>
        <item>Except those who repent and believe and do good deeds,
and therefore they will enter the Paradise and will not be wronged at
all.</item>
        <item>They will enter) the Gardens of eternity, promised by
the All-Merciful (Allah) to His servants, in the unseen world. They
will surely reach (the places of) His promise.</item>
        <item>They will not hear anything absurd therein, but a word
of peace, and there they will have their provision at morn and eve.
</item>
        <item>That is the Paradise We will give as inheritance ⁹to
those of Our servants who have been God-fearing.</item>
        <item>Jibra’il (A.S) said to the Holy Prophet (S.A.W)) “We do
not descend but with the command of your Lord. ¹⁰To Him belongs what is
in front of us and what is behind us and what is in between; and your
Lord is not the One who forgets.</item>
        <item>He is) the Lord of the heavens and the earth and
whatever lies between them. So, worship Him and persevere in His
worship. Do you know any one worthy of His name?”</item>
        <item>Man says, “Is it that, once I die, I shall be brought
forth alive?”</item>
        <item>Does not the man remember that We created him before,
when he was nothing?</item>
        <item>So, by your Lord, We will definitely gather them
together, and the devils as well; then We will definitely make them
present around the Jahannam , fallen on their knees.</item>
        <item>Then, out of every group, We will certainly draw out
those who were more rebellious against the All-Merciful (Allah).
</item>
        <item>Then of course, We are most aware of those who are more
deserving to enter it (the Jahannam ).</item>
        <item>There is none among you who does not have to arrive at
it. ¹¹This is undertaken by your Lord as an absolute decree, bound to
be enforced.</item>
        <item>Then We will save those who feared Allah, and will leave
the wrongdoers in it, fallen on their knees.</item>
        <item>When Our verses are recited to them in all their
clarity, the disbelievers say to the believers, “Which of the two
groups is superior in its place and better in its assembly?” ¹²</item>
        <item>How many a generation We have destroyed before them who
were better in assets and outlook!</item>
        <item>Say, “Whoever stays straying, let his term be extended
by the All-Merciful (Allah) still longer, until when they will see
what they are being warned of: either the punishment or the Hour (of
Doom), then they will know who was worse in his place and weaker in
his forces.</item>
        <item>Allah makes those on the right path excel in guidance.
And the everlasting virtues are better with your Lord in respect of
reward and better in their return.</item>
        <item>Have you, then, seen him who rejected Our verses and
said, “I shall certainly be given wealth and children”? ¹³</item>
        <item>Has he peeped into the Unseen or taken a covenant with
the All-Merciful (Allah)?</item>
        <item>Never! We will write what he says and extend for him the
punishment extensively.</item>
        <item>And We will inherit from him what he is talking about,
and he will come to Us all alone.</item>
        <item>They have taken gods other than Allah, so that they may
be a source of might for them.</item>
        <item>Never! They (their fabricated deities) will soon reject
their having worshipped them, ¹⁴and they will be just the opposite for
them.</item>
        <item>Have you not seen that We have sent the devils onto the
disbelievers inciting them with all their incitements.</item>
        <item>So make no hurry about them; We are but counting for
them a count down. ¹⁵</item>
        <item>The day We will assemble the God-fearing before the AllMerciful (Allah) as guests,</item>
        <item>And will drive the sinners towards the Jahannam as herds
of cattle (are driven) towards water,</item>
        <item>None will have power to intercede, except the one who
has entered into a covenant with the All-Merciful (Allah).</item>
        <item>They say, “The All-Merciful (Allah) has got a
son.”</item>
        <item>Indeed you have come up with such an abominable
statement</item>
        <item>That the heavens are well-nigh to explode at it, and the
earth to burst apart, and the mountains to fall down crumbling,</item>
        <item>For they have ascribed a son to the All-Merciful
(Allah),</item>
        <item>While it does not behove the All-Merciful to have a son.
</item>
        <item>There is none in the heavens and the earth, but bound to
come to the All-Merciful as a slave.</item>
        <item>He has fully encompassed them and precisely calculated
their numbers,</item>
        <item>And each one of them is bound to come to Him on the Day
of Judgment, all alone.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who believe and do righteous deeds, for
them the All-Merciful (Allah) will create love.</item>
        <item>So We have made it (the Qur’an) easy through your
tongue, so that you give with it the good news to the God-fearing, and
warn with it an obstinate people.</item>
        <item>And how many a generation We have destroyed before them!
Do you sense (the presence of) any one of them, or hear from them even
a whisper?</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Ta Ha ¹</item>
        <item>We did not reveal the Qur’an to you to (make you) face
hardship</item>
        <item>Rather to remind him who has the fear (of Allah),</item>
        <item>It being a revelation from the One Who created the
earth, and high heavens.</item>
        <item>The Rahman (Allah, the All-Merciful) has positioned
Himself on the Throne.</item>
        <item>To Him belongs all that is in the heavens, all that is
in the earth and whatever lies between them and whatever lies beneath
the soil.</item>
        <item>If you pronounce the word aloud, then (it makes no
difference, for) He certainly knows the secret and what is even more
hidden. ²</item>
        <item>Such is) Allah. There is no god but He. For Him are the
Beautiful Names.</item>
        <item>Has there come to you the story of Musa?</item>
        <item>When he saw a fire and said to his family, “Stay here. I
have noticed a fire. Perhaps I can bring you an ember from it, or find
some guidance by the fire.” ³</item>
        <item>So when he came to it, he was called, “O Musa,</item>
        <item>It is Me, your Lord, so remove your shoes; you are in
the sacred valley of Tuwa.</item>
        <item>I have chosen you (for prophet-hood), so listen to what
is revealed:</item>
        <item>Surely, I AM ALLAH. There is no god but Myself, so
worship Me, and establish Salah for My remembrance.</item>
        <item>Surely, the Hour (i.e. the Day of Judgment) has to come.
I would keep it secret, so that everyone is given a return for the
effort one makes.</item>
        <item>So the one who does not believe in it and follows his
desires must not make you neglectful of it, otherwise you will perish.
</item>
        <item>And what is that in your right hand, O Musa?”</item>
        <item>He said, “It is my staff. I lean on it, and I beat down
leaves with it for my sheep, and I have many other uses for
it.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Throw it down O Musa”.</item>
        <item>So, he threw it down, and suddenly it was a snake,
running around.</item>
        <item>He said, “Pick it up, and be not scared. We shall
restore it to its former state.</item>
        <item>And press your hand under your arm, and it will come out
(brightly) white without any disease, as another sign,</item>
        <item>So that We may show you some of Our great signs.</item>
        <item>Go to Pharaoh. He has really exceeded all
bounds.”</item>
        <item>He said, “My Lord, put my heart at peace for me,</item>
        <item>And make my task easy for me</item>
        <item>And remove the knot from my tongue, ⁴</item>
        <item>So that they may understand my speech.</item>
        <item>And make for me an assistant from my own family,</item>
        <item>That is, Harun, my brother.</item>
        <item>Enhance with him my strength,</item>
        <item>And make him share my task,</item>
        <item>So that we proclaim Your purity in abundance</item>
        <item>And remember You in abundance.</item>
        <item>You are certainly watchful over us.”</item>
        <item>He said, “You have been granted your request O Musa.
</item>
        <item>And We had bestowed Our favour on you another time,
</item>
        <item>When We revealed to your mother what was to be revealed,
⁵</item>
        <item>That is, ‘Put him (the baby) in the chest, ⁶then cast it
into the river, then let the river throw it by the shore, and it will
be picked up by one who is enemy to Me and enemy to him.’ And I had
cast love on you from Myself (so that you might be favourite of all),
and that you might be brought up under My eye.</item>
        <item>Remember) when your sister was going (to the family of
Pharaoh) and was saying, ‘Shall I lead you to one who nurses him?’
Thus We brought you back to your mother, so that her eyes might have
comfort and she might not grieve. And you had killed a person, then We
brought you out of the trouble; ⁷and We tested you with a great ordeal.
Then you lived a number of years amidst the people of Madyan. After
all this, you came O Musa, to a destined point of time.</item>
        <item>I have fashioned you for Myself.</item>
        <item>Go, you and your brother, with My signs, and do not be
slack in My remembrance.</item>
        <item>Go, both of you, to Pharaoh; he has indeed transgressed
all limits.</item>
        <item>So speak to him in soft words. May be, he accepts the
advice or fears (Allah)”. ⁸</item>
        <item>They said, “Our Lord, we fear that he will hasten
against us, or will become (more) rebellious (against You).”</item>
        <item>He said, “Do not be afraid. I AM surely with you both. I
hear and I see.</item>
        <item>So, come to him and say, ‘We are the messengers of your
Lord. So, let the children of Isra’il go with us, and do not persecute
them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord; and peace be
upon the one who follows the guidance.</item>
        <item>Verily, it has been revealed to us that the punishment
is for the one who denies and turns away.’”</item>
        <item>He (Pharaoh) said, “Who then is the Lord of you two, O
Musa?”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “Our Lord is the One who gave everything
its due shape, then guided it.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Then, what is the status of the earlier
generations?”</item>
        <item>He replied, “The knowledge about those is with my Lord
in a Book. ⁹My Lord does neither err nor forget.”</item>
        <item>He is) the One who made the earth a cradle for you, and
made in it pathways for you to move, and sent down water from the
heavens; and We brought forth with it pairs of different vegetations
¹⁰:</item>
        <item>Eat, and graze your cattle. Surely, in that there are
signs for the people of understanding.</item>
        <item>From this (dust) We created you, and in this we shall
put you back, and from this We shall raise you up once again.</item>
        <item>And We showed him (Pharaoh) all Our signs, yet he
rejected and refused.</item>
        <item>Said he, “Have you come to us to drive us out of our
land with your sorcery, O Musa?</item>
        <item>We will, then, bring to you a similar sorcery. So, make
an appointment between you and us for an even place, not to be backed
out, neither by us nor by you.”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “Your appointment is the festival day,
and the people should be assembled at forenoon.”</item>
        <item>So, Pharaoh turned back, and put his plot together, then
came.</item>
        <item>Musa said to them, “Pity on you, do not fabricate a lie
against Allah, lest He should destroy you with a punishment. And loser
is he who fabricates a lie.”</item>
        <item>Then, they disputed among themselves in their matter,
and kept their talk secret.</item>
        <item>Said they, “Certainly, these two are sorcerers who wish
to drive you out from your land, and do away with your excellent way
of life.</item>
        <item>So, make your plot firm and come forth in one row.
Successful today is the one who prevails.”</item>
        <item>They said, “O Musa, either you throw (first), or shall
we be first to throw?”</item>
        <item>He said, “Rather, you throw.” Then, suddenly their ropes
and sticks seemed to him, due to their magic, as if they were running.
</item>
        <item>So, Musa concealed some fear in his heart.</item>
        <item>We said, “Do not be scared. Certainly, you are to be the
upper most.</item>
        <item>And throw what is in your right hand, and it will devour
what they have concocted. What they have concocted is but a sleight of
a magician. And the magician does not succeed wherever he comes
from.”</item>
        <item>So, the magicians were led (by the truth) to fall in
prostration. They said, “We have (now) believed in the Lord of Harun
and Musa.”</item>
        <item>He (Pharaoh) said, “You have believed in him before I
permit you. This man is in fact your master who has taught you the
magic. So I will certainly cut off your hands and your legs from
opposite sides, and will crucify you on the trunks of palm-trees, and
you shall know whose punishment, out of us, ¹¹is more severe and more
lasting.”</item>
        <item>They said, “We will never prefer you over the clear
signs that have come to us, and over Him who has created us. So,
decide whatever you have to decide. You will decide only for this
worldly life.</item>
        <item>We have put our faith in our Lord, so that He forgives
us for our sins and for the magic you compelled us to perform. And
Allah is the Best and Everlasting.”</item>
        <item>Surely whoever comes to his Lord as a sinner, for him
there is Jahannam in which he neither will die nor will live (a happy
life).</item>
        <item>And whoever will come to Him as believer, having done
righteous deeds, for such people there are the highest ranks,</item>
        <item>The eternal gardens beneath which rivers flow, in which
they shall live for ever. That is the reward for the one who has
purified himself.</item>
        <item>And We revealed to Musa saying, “Set out with my
servants at night, then make for them a dry path across the sea (with
the strike of your staff), neither fearing to be caught up, nor having
any fear (of drowning).”</item>
        <item>Then Pharaoh chased them with his troops. So, they were
encircled by that (huge wave) from the sea which overwhelmed them.
</item>
        <item>Pharaoh held his people astray, and did not show them
the right path.</item>
        <item>O children of Isra’il , We delivered you from your enemy
and appointed for you the right side of the mount Tur (Sinai), and
sent down for you the Mann and Salwa : ¹²</item>
        <item>Eat from the good things We have provided to you, and do
not exceed the limits in it, lest My wrath should descend on you. The
one upon whom My wrath descends certainly falls into destruction.
</item>
        <item>Surely I am the Most-Forgiving for him who repents and
believes and acts righteously, then follows the right path.</item>
        <item>What has caused you to hurry before your people, O
Musa?” ¹³</item>
        <item>He said, “Here they are just behind me, and I hurried
towards You, my Lord, so that You be pleased.”</item>
        <item>He said, “We have then put your people to test after you
(left them) and Samiriyy ¹⁴has misguided them.”</item>
        <item>So, Musa went back to his people, angry and sad. He
said, “O my people, did your Lord not promise you a good promise? Did
then the time become too long for you, ¹⁵or did you wish that wrath
from your Lord befalls you, and hence you broke your promise to me?”
¹⁶</item>
        <item>They said, “We did not break our promise to you of our
own accord, but we were burdened with loads from the ornaments of the
people; ¹⁷ so we threw them, and thus did Samiriyy cast.” ¹⁸</item>
        <item>Then he brought forth for them a calf, which was
(merely) a body with a lowing sound. Then they said, “This is your god
and the god of Musa, and he (Musa) erred.”</item>
        <item>Have they not been seeing that it did not respond to
them (even) with a word, nor did it have power to harm or benefit
them?</item>
        <item>Harun had already said to them, “O my people, you have
only been led astray with it, and your Lord is the Rahman (AllMerciful). So follow me and obey my command.” ¹⁹</item>
        <item>They said, “We will never cease to stay with it in
devotion, until Musa returns to us.”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “O Harun, what did prevent you from
following me when you saw them going astray?</item>
        <item>Did you then disobey my command?”</item>
        <item>He said, “O son of my mother, do not hold me by my
beard, nor by my head. I feared that you would say, ‘You have caused
discord among the children of Isra’il and did not observe my
advice.’”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “What then is your case, O
Samiriyy?”</item>
        <item>He said, “I perceived something they did not perceive.
So I picked up a handful from under the footstep of the messenger.
Then, I cast it. ²⁰And thus my inner self tempted me.”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “Then go away; it is destined for you
that, throughout your life, you will say: ‘Do not touch me’. ²¹ and,
of course, you have another promise that will not be broken for you.
²²nd look at your god to which you stayed devoted. We will certainly
burn it, then we willscatter it thoroughly in the sea.</item>
        <item>Your God is Allah other than whom there is no god. He
encompasses everything with knowledge.”</item>
        <item>This is how We narrate to you certain events of what has
passed, and We have given to you, from Ourself, a (book of) advice.
</item>
        <item>Whoever turns away from it shall certainly bear a heavy
burden on Doomsday,</item>
        <item>All such people living under it forever. And how evil
for them will be that burden on the Doomsday!</item>
        <item>The Day when the Horn (Sur) will be blown, and We shall
gather the guilty together while they will have turned blue on that
day,</item>
        <item>And will be whispering among themselves, “You did not
remain (in graves) more than ten (days)”.</item>
        <item>We know very well what they say, when the best of them
in his ways will say, “You did not remain more than one day.”
²³</item>
        <item>They ask you about the mountains. ²⁴So, say (to them),
“My Lord will crush them into dust thoroughly,</item>
        <item>Then will turn them into a leveled plain</item>
        <item>In which you will see neither a curve nor an uneven
place.”</item>
        <item>That day they will follow the caller who will find no
deviation (from anyone). And the voices will turn low in awe for the
Rahman (All-Merciful, Allah). So, you will hear not but whispering.
</item>
        <item>That day no intercession will be of any use to anyone,
except the one whom the Rahman (All-Merciful, Allah) has permitted and
was pleased with his word.</item>
        <item>He knows what is in front of them and what is behind
them, and they do not encompass Him in (their) knowledge.</item>
        <item>All faces will be humbled before (Allah,) the EverAlive, the All-Sustaining; and the loser will be the one who bears
(the burden of his) injustice.</item>
        <item>But whoever does righteous deeds, while he is a
believer, shall fear neither injustice nor curtailment (of his
rewards).</item>
        <item>And in this way We have sent it down to you as an Arabic
Qur’an, and have detailed in it some warnings in various ways, so that
they may fear, or it may produce a lesson for them.</item>
        <item>So High above all is Allah, the True King! And do not
hasten with (reciting) the Qur’an before its revelation to you is
concluded, ²⁵and say, “My Lord, improve me in knowledge.”</item>
        <item>We had given a directive to ’Adam earlier, then he
forgot, and We did not find in him a firm resolve.</item>
        <item>When We said to the angels, “Prostrate yourselves to
’Adam”. So, all of them fell prostrate, except Iblis , who refused.
</item>
        <item>So, We said “’Adam, this is an enemy to you and to your
wife. So let him not expel you from Paradise, lest you should get into
trouble.</item>
        <item>Here you have the privilege that you will not be hungry
nor will you be unclad,</item>
        <item>And you will not be thirsty, nor will you be exposed to
sun.”</item>
        <item>Then the Satan instigated him. He said, “’Adam, shall I
guide you to the tree of eternity and to an empire that does not
decay?” ²⁶</item>
        <item>So, both of them [‘Adam and Hawwa’ (Eve)] ate from it,
and their parts of shame were exposed to them, and they started
stitching on themselves some of the leaves of Paradise. And ’Adam
disobeyed his Lord, and erred. ²⁷</item>
        <item>Thereafter his Lord chose him. So He accepted his
repentance and gave (him) guidance.</item>
        <item>He said (to ’Adam and Iblis), “Go down from here, all of
you, some of you enemies of some others. Then, should some guidance
come to you from Me, the one who follows My guidance shall not go
astray, nor shall he be in trouble.</item>
        <item>As for the one who turns away from My message, he shall
have a straitened life, and We shall raise him blind on the Day of
Judgment.” ²⁸</item>
        <item>He will say, “My Lord, why did you raise me blind while
I was sighted?”</item>
        <item>He will say, “In the similar manner as Our signs came to
you, and you had ignored them. In the same way you will be ignored
today.”</item>
        <item>Thus We recompense him who exceeds the limits and does
not believe in the signs of his Lord. Certainly the punishment of the
Hereafter is more severe and more lasting.</item>
        <item>Did it give them no guidance (to realize) how many
generations We have destroyed prior to them in whose dwellings they
(often) walk around? Surely, in this there are signs for the men of
reason.</item>
        <item>But for a word from your Lord that had passed earlier,
and an appointed time that had been fixed, it (the punishment) would
have been inevitable (for them).</item>
        <item>So, (O messenger,) endure with patience what they say,
and proclaim the purity and praise of your Lord before sunrise and
before sunset. And in some hours of night, proclaim His purity, and at
points of the day as well, so that you may be pleased.</item>
        <item>Never stretch your eyes towards the things We have given
to some groups of them to enjoy, so that We put them to test thereby,
it being merely glamour of the worldly life. And the bounty of your
Lord is much better and more lasting.</item>
        <item>Bid your family to perform Salah, and adhere to it
yourself. We ask no provision from you. We give provision to you. And
the ultimate end is in favour of Taqwa (God-fearing, and piety).
</item>
        <item>They say, “Why does he not bring to us a sign from his
Lord?” Has there not come to them the clear sign of what is contained
in the earlier Scriptures? ²⁹</item>
        <item>And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before
it, they would have said, “Our Lord, why did you not send a messenger
to us, so that we might have followed Your signs before we were
humiliated and put to disgrace?”</item>
        <item>Say, “Everyone is waiting. So wait, then you will know
who the people of the straight path are and who has followed the right
guidance.”</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>The reckoning of the people has drawn near to them,
while they are in negligence, turning away (from its signs).</item>
        <item>No fresh message of advice comes to them from their
Lord, but they listen to it as if they were playing,</item>
        <item>Their hearts paying no heed. And the wrongdoers whisper
in secret, “This one is nothing but a mortal like you. Would you then
go along with sorcery while you can see (the reality)?” ¹</item>
        <item>He (the prophet) said, “My Lord knows all that is spoken
in the heavens and the earth, and He is the All-Hearing, the AllKnowing.”</item>
        <item>Further they said, “(The Qur’an is) a mixture of jumble
dreams. Rather, he (the prophet) has fabricated it. Rather, he is a
poet. So, let him bring a sign to us, as the earlier ones were sent
with.”</item>
        <item>Not a single town from those whom We destroyed came to
believe before them. So, will they believe?</item>
        <item>And We did not send before you messengers except men
whom We inspired with revelation. So, ask the people (having the
knowledge) of the Message, if you do not know. ²</item>
        <item>We did not make them such bodies as ate no food, nor
were they immortal.</item>
        <item>Then We caused the promise to come true for them, so We
saved them and those whom We willed, and destroyed the transgressors.
</item>
        <item>Surely, We have sent down to you (O people of Arabia) a
book having a good counsel for you. ³So, do you not understand?</item>
        <item>How many a town, that were unjust, have We crushed and
raised up after them another people!</item>
        <item>So, as soon as they sensed Our punishment (approaching
them), they started fleeing from it.</item>
        <item>It was said to them,) “Do not flee, and go back to the
luxuries you were made to enjoy, and to your dwellings. May be you are
asked questions.” ⁴</item>
        <item>They said, “Alas for us! We were wrongdoers
indeed.”</item>
        <item>Then, this continued to be their cry till We turned them
into stubble, totally extinguished.</item>
        <item>We did not create the heavens and the earth and what
lies between them for play.</item>
        <item>Had We intended to have a pastime, We would have had it
from Our own, if We were ever to do so. ⁵</item>
        <item>Instead, We launch the truth against falsehood, which
gets it smashed, and in no time it is gone. Alas to you for what you
describe!</item>
        <item>To Him belong all those in the heavens and the earth.
And those who are near to Him are not arrogant against His worship,
nor are they sluggish.</item>
        <item>They proclaim His purity night and day, never
slackening.</item>
        <item>Or have they adopted gods from the earth, who raise the
dead?</item>
        <item>Had there been gods beside Allah, in the heavens and the
earth, both of them would have fallen in disorder. ⁶So pure is Allah,
the Lord of the Throne, from what they describe.</item>
        <item>He is not questioned of what He does, and they are
questioned.</item>
        <item>Is it that they have adopted gods besides Him? Say,
“Bring your proof.” Here is the (book carrying) advice for those with
me, and the (books carrying) advice for those before me. ⁷Yet most of
them do not know the truth, and therefore they are averse.</item>
        <item>We did not send before you any messenger but We revealed
to him that there is no god but I, so worship Me.”</item>
        <item>They said, “The Rahman (the All-Merciful, Allah) has
taken children for Himself.” Pure is He (from having children). They
are but (His) honored servants. ⁸</item>
        <item>They do not precede Him in speech, and only under His
command they act.</item>
        <item>He knows what is in front of them and what is behind
them, and they make recommendation for none but for whom He likes, and
in awe of Him they are fearful.</item>
        <item>Should any one of them say, “I am god besides Him”, We
will recompense him with Jahannam (Hell). This is how We recompense
the transgressors.</item>
        <item>Did the disbelievers not observe that the heavens and
the earth were closed, then We opened them? ⁹And We created from water
every living thing. Would they still not believe?</item>
        <item>And We created mountains on the earth, lest it should
shake with them, and We have made therein paths and ways, so that they
are guided.</item>
        <item>We made the sky a protected roof; and they are averse to
its signs.</item>
        <item>He is the One who has created the night and the day, and
the sun and the moon, each floating in an orbit.</item>
        <item>We did not assign immortality to any human (even) before
you. So, if you die, will they live for ever?</item>
        <item>Every one has to taste death, and We test you through
bad and good (situations) with a trial, and to Us you are to be
returned.</item>
        <item>When disbelievers see you, they do nothing but take you
in jest (saying to one another,) “Is this the one who talks of your
gods?” _ while they themselves reject even talking of the Rahman (AllMerciful).</item>
        <item>Man is made of haste. ¹⁰I shall show you My signs, so do
not seek haste from Me.</item>
        <item>They say, “When will this promise be (fulfilled), if you
are true?”</item>
        <item>Only if the disbelievers were to know the time when they
will not (be able to) keep off the fire from their faces or from their
backs, nor will they be helped.</item>
        <item>Rather, it will come upon them suddenly and will baffle
them. So they will not be able to turn it back, nor will they be given
respite.</item>
        <item>In fact, messengers have been mocked at prior to you. So
those who laughed at them were besieged by what they used to ridicule.
</item>
        <item>Say, “Who will guard you, during night and day, against
the Rahman (All-Merciful, Allah)?” Rather, to the remembrance of their
Lord they are averse.</item>
        <item>Or do they have gods who protect them besides Us? They
are not able to help even themselves, nor will they have anyone to
side with them against Us.</item>
        <item>But We have given benefits to these and their fathers
until life was prolonged for them. So do they not see that We are
coming to the land narrowing it down from all its sides? Then, are
they the ones to prevail? ¹¹</item>
        <item>Say, “I warn you only by revelation, but the deaf do not
listen to the call when they are warned.”</item>
        <item>If a whiff of your Lord’s torment were to touch them,
they would certainly say, “Alas to us! We were wrongdoers
indeed.”</item>
        <item>We shall place scales to do justice on the Day of
Judgment. So no one shall be wronged in the least. Even if it (a deed)
is to the measure of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth, and We
are enough to take account.</item>
        <item>And We gave Musa and Harun the Criterion, and a light
and an advice for the God-fearing,</item>
        <item>Those who have awe of their Lord without having seen
Him, and are fearful of the Hour (of Judgment).</item>
        <item>And this is a blessed advice We have sent down. Are you
still rejecting it?</item>
        <item>Even earlier We had given Ibrahim his right course, and
We knew him well</item>
        <item>When he said to his father and his people, “What are
these statues you are devoted to?”</item>
        <item>They said, “We found our fathers worshipping
them,”</item>
        <item>He said, “Surely you and your fathers have been in open
error.”</item>
        <item>They said, “Did you come to us with truth or are you one
of the triflers?”</item>
        <item>He said, “No, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and
the earth, who has created them, and I am one of those who bear
witness to it.</item>
        <item>And I swear by Allah that I will devise something
against your idols after you have gone away turning your backs.”
¹²</item>
        <item>Then, he turned all of them into pieces, except the big
one of them, so that they may come back to it.</item>
        <item>They said, “Who has done this to our gods? He is one of
the wrongdoers indeed.”</item>
        <item>Some of them said, “We have heard a youth talking about
them. He is called Ibrahim.”</item>
        <item>They said, “Then, bring him before the eyes of the
people, so that they may see”.</item>
        <item>They said, “Is it you O Ibrahim who has done this to our
gods?”</item>
        <item>He said, “Rather, this is done by this chief of theirs.
So, ask them if they can speak.”</item>
        <item>So they turned to one another and said, “In fact, you
yourselves are the wrongdoers.”</item>
        <item>Then, hanging their heads they reversed their position
(and replied to Ibrahim,) “You already knew that they do not
speak.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Do you then worship, beside Allah, what does
neither benefit you in the least nor harm you?</item>
        <item>Fie upon you and upon what you worship other than Allah.
Do you then not understand?”</item>
        <item>They said, “(O people) burn him and help your gods, if
you are to take action.”</item>
        <item>We said, “O fire, be cold and safe for Ibrahim.”</item>
        <item>And they intended to harm him, but We made them the
worst losers.</item>
        <item>And We rescued him and Lut towards the land we blessed
for all the worlds. ¹³</item>
        <item>And We blessed him with Ishaq and Ya‘qub as gift, and
each one of them We made righteous.</item>
        <item>And We made them the Imams who guided (people) under Our
command, and We inspired them to do good deeds and to establish Salah
and pay Zakah, and Us alone they worshipped.</item>
        <item>As for Lut, We gave him wisdom and knowledge, and We
delivered him from the town that used to do dirty deeds. ¹⁴Indeed, they
were the people of evil, the sinners.</item>
        <item>And We admitted him to Our mercy. Indeed, He was of the
righteous.</item>
        <item>And (remember) Nuh, when he called (for help) earlier,
so We responded to him and saved him and his family from the terrible
agony,</item>
        <item>And helped him against the people who gave the lie to
Our verses. Indeed, they were the people of evil, therefore, We
drowned them all. ¹⁵</item>
        <item>And (remember) Dawud (David) and Sulaiman (Solomon),
when they were adjudicating about the tillage in which the goats of
other people wandered at night (and trampled it), and We were witness
to their judgment.</item>
        <item>So, We enabled Sulaiman to understand it. ¹⁶And to each
one of them We gave wisdom and knowledge. And with Dawud We subjugated
the mountains that pronounced tasbih (Allah’s purity), and the birds
as well. ¹⁷And We were the One who did (it).</item>
        <item>We taught him the skill of making armor as dress for you
to protect you from what may harm you (in combat). So are you
grateful?</item>
        <item>And for Sulaiman, (We subjugated) the violent wind that
blew under his command to the land in which We placed Our blessings.
¹⁸And We were the One who knew everything.</item>
        <item>And from the devils, (We subjugated for him) those who
dived in water for him and did jobs other than that. And We were the
One who kept watch over them.</item>
        <item>And (remember) Ayyub (Job), when he called his Lord
saying, “Here I am, afflicted by pain and You are the most merciful of
all the merciful.”</item>
        <item>So, We answered his prayer and removed whatever pain he
had, and gave him (back) his family and the like thereof along with
them, as a mercy from Our own Self and as a lesson for the
worshippers. ¹⁹</item>
        <item>And (remember) Isma‘il and Idris and Dhul-Kifl. Each one
of them was of those who observed patience.</item>
        <item>And We admitted them to Our mercy. Surely, they were of
the righteous.</item>
        <item>And (remember) Dhunnun (the man of the fish, namely
Yunus (A.S)), when he walked away in anger and thought that We would
never put him to trouble. Then, he called (Us) in depths of darkness
saying, “There is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed I was among the
wrongdoers”.</item>
        <item>So We responded to him and rescued him from the
distress. And this is how We rescue the believers. ²⁰</item>
        <item>And (remember) Zakariyya when he called his Lord, “My
Lord, do not leave me alone and You are the best of inheritors.”
²¹</item>
        <item>So, We responded to him and gave him Yahya and made his
wife good for him. They used to race towards the good deeds and call
Us with hope and fear; and they were humble to Us.</item>
        <item>And (remember) her who protected her private part (that
is, Maryam (A.S)). So, We blew in her (a life) through Our Spirit, and
made her and her son (‘Isa (A.S)) a sign for all the worlds.</item>
        <item>Surely, this is the fraternity of your Faith, a single
Faith, and I am your Lord; so worship Me.</item>
        <item>But they have separated their ways from one another. All
of them have to return to Us.</item>
        <item>So, whoever does righteous deeds, while he is a
believer, his effort will not be rejected, and We are to put it on
record.</item>
        <item>It is banned for (the people of) a town that We
destroyed that they come back ²²</item>
        <item>Until when the Ya’juj and Ma’juj (Gog and Magog) are
released, while they run down from every height,</item>
        <item>And the True Promise draws near, then it will so happen
that the eyes of the disbelievers shall remain upraised (in terror,
and they will say,) “Alas to us! We were in negligence about this;
rather we were transgressors.”</item>
        <item>Surely, you and whatever you worship other than Allah
are the fuel of Jahannam.. ²³There you will have to arrive.</item>
        <item>Had they been gods, they would not have arrived at it,
and all of them will remain there forever.</item>
        <item>For them, there will be screams in it and they will not
hear.</item>
        <item>As for those for whom the good (news) from Us has come
earlier, they will be kept far away from it.</item>
        <item>They will not hear the slightest of its sound, and they
will remain forever in what their souls desire.</item>
        <item>They shall not be grieved by the Biggest Panic, and the
angels shall receive them (saying), “This is your day that you had
been promised”</item>
        <item>The Day when We roll up the sky like a scroll rolls up
the writings. Just as We originated the first creation, so We shall
bring it back again - a promise (undertaken to be binding) on Us. We
are sure to do it.</item>
        <item>And We have written in Zabur (Psalms) after the advice
that the land will be inherited by My righteous slaves. ²⁴</item>
        <item>Surely, in this (Qur’an) there is a message conveyed to
a people who worship (Allah).</item>
        <item>And We have not sent you but as mercy for all the
worlds.</item>
        <item>Say, “What is revealed to me is simply that your God is
One God. So do you submit?”</item>
        <item>But, if they turn away, then say (to them), “I have
warned you all alike, and I do not know whether what you have been
warned of is near or far.</item>
        <item>Surely, He knows what is spoken openly and He knows what
you conceal.</item>
        <item>And I do not know ²⁵; perhaps it is a trial for you and
an enjoyment for a while.”</item>
        <item>He (Our Messenger) said, “My Lord, judge with truth. And
Our Lord is the Rahman (All-Merciful), the One whose help is sought
against what you describe.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>O mankind, fear your Lord. Indeed the quake of the
(destined) Hour is something terrible.</item>
        <item>The day you will see it, every suckling female will
forget that which she suckles, and every female having pregnancy shall
abort her fetus, and you will see people as if they are drunk, while
they are not drunk, but Allah’s torment is (so) severe.</item>
        <item>Among the people there is one who debates about Allah
without knowledge, and follows every rebellious Satan,</item>
        <item>About whom it is destined that if someone takes him for
friend, he will misguide him and lead him to the torment of the Fire.
</item>
        <item>O mankind, if you are in doubt about Resurrection, then
(recall that) We created you from dust, then from a drop of semen,
then from a clot, then from a piece of flesh, either shaped or
unshaped, so that We manifest (Our power) to you. We retain in the
wombs whatever We will to a specified term. Then We bring you out as
babies, then (We nourish you) so that you reach your maturity. And
among you there is one who dies, and among you there is one who is
carried to the worst part of the age, so that he knows nothing even
after having knowledge.And you see the land dry. Then once We send
down water on it, it stirs and swells and puts forth every pleasant
pair (of vegetation).</item>
        <item>That is because Allah is the truth, and that He gives
life to the dead, and that He is powerful to do everything,</item>
        <item>And that the Hour (of Doom) has to come, in which there
is no doubt, and that Allah will raise again all those in the graves.
</item>
        <item>Among men there is one who debates about Allah with no
knowledge, no guidance and no enlightening book,</item>
        <item>Turning his side away to lead (people) astray from the
way of Allah. For him there is disgrace in this world, and We will
have him taste the punishment of Fire on the Day of Judgment</item>
        <item>And will say to him) “All this is due to what your hands
sent ahead, and that Allah is not unjust to His servants.”</item>
        <item>And among men there is one who worships Allah (standing)
on the verge: so if some good thing happens to him, he is satisfied
with it, and if a trial befalls him, he turns his face back. He loses
both this world and the Hereafter. That is the manifest loss. ¹</item>
        <item>He prays to someone, instead of Allah, who can neither
harm him nor benefit him. That is the error that takes him too far
from the right path.</item>
        <item>He, rather, prays to someone whose harm is more likely
than his benefit. Wretched is such a patron and wretched is such a
companion.</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah will admit those who believe and do good
deeds into gardens beneath which rivers flow. Surely Allah does what
He intends.</item>
        <item>If someone thinks that Allah will never help him (the
prophet) in this world and in the Hereafter, he should stretch a rope
to the sky, then cut (Allah’s communication) off (from the prophet)
and see whether his effort can really remove what irritates (him).
²</item>
        <item>And this is how We have sent it (the Qur’an) down as
clear signs, and the fact is that Allah leads whom He wills to the
right path.</item>
        <item>As for those who believe and the Jews and the Sabians
³and the Christians and the Magians ⁴and those who ascribe partners to
Allah, Allah will judge between them on the Day of Judgment. Surely
Allah is witness to every thing.</item>
        <item>Have you not seen that to Allah prostrate all those in
the skies and all those on the earth, and the sun, the moon, the
stars, the mountains, the trees, the animals and many from mankind?
And there are many on whom punishment has become due. And the one whom
Allah puts to disgrace, there is none to give him respect. Surely
Allah does what He wills.</item>
        <item>⁵ These are two opponents who have disputed about their
Lord. As for those who disbelieve, garments from fire shall be
tailored for them, and boiling water shall be poured from over their
heads</item>
        <item>Whereby everything in their bellies, as well as the
skins, will be melted.</item>
        <item>And for them there are hooked rods of iron.</item>
        <item>Whenever, in their anguish, they will intend to come out
of it (the fire), they will be turned back to it, and (it will be said
to them,) “Taste the punishment of burning”.</item>
        <item>Surely Allah will admit those who believe and do good
deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow. They will be adorned
therein with bracelets of gold and with pearls, and their dress
therein will be (of) silk.</item>
        <item>Guided they were to the good word (of faith) and guided
they were to the path of (Allah,) the Praised One.</item>
        <item>Surely (We will punish) those who disbelieve and prevent
(people) from the way of Allah and from Al-Masjid-ul-Haram (the Sacred
Mosque), which We have made for all men, where residents and visitors
are all equal. ⁶And whoever intends therein to commit deviation with
injustice, We will make him taste a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>And (remember) when We pointed out for Ibrahim the place
of the House (of Allah) saying, “Do not associate anything with Me as
My partner, and purify My House for those who make tawaf
(circumambulation around it), and those who perform Qiyam (standing up
in worship) and those who perform Ruku‘ (bowing down) and Sujud
(prostration),</item>
        <item>And announce among people about (the obligation of)
Hajj, so that they should come to you on foot, and on every camel
turned lean, traveling through every distant hilly pathway,</item>
        <item>So that they witness benefits for them, and recite
Allah’s name in specified days, over the provision He gave them from
the cattle. “So, eat thereof and feed the distressed, the
poor.”</item>
        <item>Then, they must remove their dirt, and fulfill their
vows, and make tawaf of the Ancient House.” ⁷</item>
        <item>Having said that, whoever observes reverence of the
things sanctified by Allah, it is good for him with his Lord. And
permitted to you are the cattle, except those mentioned to you through
recitation (of the verses). So refrain from the filth of the idols and
refrain from a word of falsehood,</item>
        <item>Standing upright for (the obedience of) Allah, not
ascribing any partner to Him. Whoever ascribes a partner to Allah, it
is as if he falls down from the sky, and either the birds snatch him,
or the wind drives him away to a far off place. ⁸</item>
        <item>Having said that, if one observes the sanctity of the
symbols of Allah, then such things emanate from the piety of the
hearts.</item>
        <item>And for you there are benefits in them (the cattle) up
to a specified time. Then their place of sacrifice is by the Ancient
House. ⁹</item>
        <item>For every Ummah (religious community) We prescribed the
act of sacrifice, so that they recite Allah’s name over the provision
He gave them from the cattle. So, your God is One God. Therefore, to
Him alone you must submit. And give good news to those who turn to Him
with humbleness -</item>
        <item>Those whose hearts are filled with awe when Allah is
remembered, and who observe patience against whatever befalls them,
and who are steadfast in Salah, and who spend (in the way of Allah)
out of what We have given to them.</item>
        <item>The big animals of sacrifice (like camels and cows) are
made by Us among the symbols of Allah for you, in which there is much
good for your benefit. So recite the name of Allah over them as they
are lined up (for sacrifice). Then, once their flanks fall down (after
slaughter), eat of them and feed the one who is content and the one
who wishes to receive. ¹⁰Thus We have made them (the animals)
subjugated to you, so that you may be grateful.</item>
        <item>It is neither their flesh nor their blood that reaches
Allah, but what does reach Him is the taqwa (the sense of obedience)
on your part. Thus He has made them (the animals) subjugated to you,
so that you proclaim Allah’s glory for the guidance He gave you. And
give good news to those who are good in their deeds.</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah defends those who believe. Allah does not
love any treacherous, ungrateful.</item>
        <item>Permission (to fight) is given to those against whom
fighting is launched, because they have been wronged, and Allah is
powerful to give them victory.</item>
        <item>They are) the ones who were expelled from their homes
without any just reason, except that they say “Our Lord is Allah.” Had
Allah not been repelling some people by means of some others, the
monasteries, the churches, the synagogues and the mosques where
Allah’s name is abundantly recited would have been demolished. ¹¹Allah
will definitely help those who help Him (by defending the religion
prescribed by Him.) Surely Allah is Powerful, Mighty.</item>
        <item>The ones who help Allah are) those who, when We give
them power in the land, establish Salah, pay Zakah, bid what is Fair
and forbid what is Unfair. And with Allah lies the fate of all
matters.</item>
        <item>And if they reject you, so did reject the people of Nuh
(Noah) and ‘Ad and Thamud,</item>
        <item>And the people of Ibrahim and the people of Lut (Lot),
</item>
        <item>And the people of Madyan as well. Musa was (also)
rejected. So, I gave some respite to the disbelievers, then seized
them. So how was My censure?</item>
        <item>How many towns have We destroyed, as they were
wrongdoers! So, they are fallen down on their roofs, and (how many a)
deserted well and (how many a) well-built castle!</item>
        <item>Have they not, then, traveled on earth so that they
should have had hearts to understand with, or ears to listen with? The
fact is that it is not the eyes that turn blind, but what turns blind
is the hearts contained in the chests.</item>
        <item>They ask you to bring the punishment sooner, while Allah
will never go back on His promise. In fact, one day with your Lord is
like one thousand years according to your calculation.</item>
        <item>And how many towns were there to whom I allowed respite,
while they were wrongdoers, then I seized them. And to Me is the final
return.</item>
        <item>Say, “O people, I am no more than a plain warner for
you.</item>
        <item>So those who come to believe and do good deeds, for them
there is forgiveness and dignified provision.</item>
        <item>As for those who strive against Our signs, trying to
defeat (the prophet or the believers), they are the people of the
Fire.”</item>
        <item>We did not send any messenger before you nor a prophet,
but (he faced a situation that) when he recited (the revelation), the
Satan cast (doubts in the hearts of his opponents) about what he
recited. So, Allah nullifies what the Satan casts, then Allah makes
His verses firm, and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise</item>
        <item>All this is allowed to be done) so that He may make what
Satan casts a trial for those in whose hearts there is a disease, and
whose hearts are hard;__and surely the wrongdoers are in the utmost
antagonism__</item>
        <item>And so that those who have been given knowledge may know
that it (i.e. the revelation recited by the prophet) is the truth from
your Lord, and they may believe in it and their hearts may become
humble towards it. Allah is the Guide of the believers to the straight
path.</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieve will remain in doubt about it (the
Qur’an) forever, until the Hour (of Judgment) comes upon them
suddenly, or there comes to them the punishment of a barren day.
</item>
        <item>The kingdom, on that day, is for Allah. He will judge
between them. So, those who believed and did good deeds shall be in
gardens of bliss.</item>
        <item>As for those who disbelieved and rejected Our signs,
they are the ones for whom there is a humiliating punishment.</item>
        <item>Those who left their homeland in the way of Allah, then
were slain or died, Allah will certainly give them a good provision,
and surely, Allah is the best provider.</item>
        <item>He will definitely admit them to an entrance they will
be pleased with, and Allah is surely All-Knowing, Forbearing.</item>
        <item>Having said this, whoever afflicts (someone) with a
punishment equal to what he was afflicted with (by the latter), and
still he (the former) is (again) subjected to aggression (by the
latter), Allah will certainly help him. Indeed, Allah is MostPardoning, Most-Forgiving. ¹²</item>
        <item>That is because Allah makes night enter into the day and
makes day enter into the night ¹³and that Allah is All-Hearing, AllSeeing.</item>
        <item>That is because Allah is the truth and that whatever
they invoke beside Him is false and that Allah is the High, the Great.
</item>
        <item>Did you not see that Allah has sent down water from the
sky, whereby the land becomes green? Surely, Allah is All-Kind, AllAware.</item>
        <item>To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that
is in the earth, and surely Allah is the All-Independent, EverPraised.</item>
        <item>Did you not see that Allah has subjugated to you
everything on the earth, and the ships that sail at sea with His
command? And He holds the sky so as it cannot fall on the earth except
with His permission. Surely Allah is Very-Kind to the people, VeryMerciful.</item>
        <item>He is the One who gave life to you, then He brings death
to you, then He will give you life (again). Surely, man is very
ungrateful.</item>
        <item>For every Ummah (religious community) We have appointed
a way of worship they are to observe. Therefore, they should never
quarrel with you in the matter. And do call (them) to your Lord.
Surely, you are on straight Guidance.</item>
        <item>And if they dispute with you, say (to them), “Allah is
the best aware of what you do.”</item>
        <item>Allah will judge between you, on the Day of Judgment,
about what you used to dispute.</item>
        <item>Do you not know that Allah knows all that is in the sky
and the earth? Surely, that is contained in a Book. Indeed it is so
easy for Allah.</item>
        <item>They worship, besides Allah, the objects for which He
did never send down an authority (or proof) and about which they have
no knowledge. And for the wrongdoers there is no helper.</item>
        <item>When Our verses are recited to them in all their
clarity, you (can) recognize disgust on the faces of the disbelievers.
They seem to attack those who recite to them Our verses. Say, “Shall
I, then, tell you about something more disgusting than that? The Fire!
Allah has promised it to those who disbelieve. And it is an evil
end.”</item>
        <item>O people, here is a parable set forth to you, so listen
to it carefully: All those whom you invoke besides Allah can never
create (even) a fly, even though they all join hands together for
that. And if a fly snatches something away from them, they cannot
release it from its possession. (Equally) feeble are the invoker and
the invoked. ¹⁴</item>
        <item>They did not recognize Allah in His true esteem. Indeed
Allah is Powerful, Mighty.</item>
        <item>Allah chooses messengers from angels and from men.
Surely, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.</item>
        <item>He knows what is in front of them and what is behind
them, and to Allah all matters are to be returned.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, bow down in Ruku‘ and bow down in
Sajdah, and worship your Lord and do good deeds, so that you achieve
success.</item>
        <item>¹⁵ Struggle for (seeking the pleasure of) Allah, a
struggle that is owed to Him. He has chosen you and did not impose any
hardship on you in the religion, the faith of your father Ibrahim. He
(Allah) named you as Muslims earlier and also in this (Qur’an), so
that the Messenger becomes a witness to you, and you become witnesses
to (other) people. ¹⁶ So establish Salah, pay Zakah and hold fast to
Allah. He is your patron. So, how excellent He is as a patron, and
how</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Success is really attained by the believers</item>
        <item>Who concentrate their attention in humbleness when
offering Salah (prayers)</item>
        <item>And who keep themselves away from vain things,</item>
        <item>And who are performers of Zakah , ¹</item>
        <item>And who guard their private parts</item>
        <item>Except from their wives or from those (bondwomen who
are) owned by their hands, as they are not to be blamed.</item>
        <item>However, those who seek (sexual pleasure) beyond that
are the transgressors</item>
        <item>And (success is attained) by those who honestly look
after their trusts and covenant,</item>
        <item>And who consistently observe their prayers.</item>
        <item>Those are the inheritors</item>
        <item>Who will inherit Firdaus (the Paradise). They will be
there forever.</item>
        <item>We have created man from an extract of clay. ²</item>
        <item>Then We made him a sperm-drop in a firm resting place.
</item>
        <item>Then We turned the sperm-drop into a clot, then We
turned the clot into a fetus-lump, then We turned the fetus-lump into
bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh; thereafter We developed
it into another creature. So, glorious is Allah, the Best of the
creators.</item>
        <item>Then, after all this, you are to die.</item>
        <item>Then you are to be raised again on the Day of Judgment.
</item>
        <item>And We created above you seven paths (heavens), and We
were never neglectful of the creation.</item>
        <item>And We sent down water from the sky in due measure, then
We lodged it in the earth, and of course, We are able to take it away.
</item>
        <item>Then We produced with it gardens of date-palms and vines
for your benefit. For you there are many fruits in them, and of them
you eat</item>
        <item>And (We produced) a tree (of olive) that comes forth
from the (mount) Tur of Sinai, which grows with oil and with a
dressing for those who eat.</item>
        <item>And indeed there is a sure lesson in the cattle for you.
We give you a drink from that which lies in their bellies, and for you
there are many benefits in them, and of them you eat,</item>
        <item>And on them and on the boats you are transported.</item>
        <item>Surely, We sent Nuh to his nation. So he said, “My
people, worship Allah. You have no god whatsoever other than Him. So,
do you not fear Allah?”</item>
        <item>So, said the disbelieving chiefs from among his nation,
“This (man) is nothing but a human being like you. He wishes to impose
his superiority over you. Had Allah willed, He would have sent down
angels (instead of him). We have not heard of such a thing among our
forefathers.</item>
        <item>He is none but a man suffering from madness; so wait for
(what happens to) him until some time”</item>
        <item>He said, “My Lord, help me, for they have rejected
me.”</item>
        <item>So, We sent Our revelation to him, saying, “Make the
ship under Our eyes and Our revelation. So, when Our command will
come, and the oven will gush forth, take on its board a pair of two
from each (species) along with your family, except those of them
against whom the word has already come to pass. And do not speak to Me
(in favor) of those who have done wrong. They are sure to be drowned.
³</item>
        <item>So, when you and those with you are well seated in the
ship, say, ‘Praise is for Allah who saved us from the wrongdoing
people.’</item>
        <item>And say, ‘My Lord, make me land a blessed landing, and
You are the best of those who bring (someone) to land’”.</item>
        <item>Surely, there are signs in it, and We do always test
(people).</item>
        <item>Then after them We created another generation,</item>
        <item>And sent among them a messenger from themselves (to
convey the message): “Worship Allah; you have no god whatsoever other
than Him. So do you not fear Allah?”</item>
        <item>Then said the chiefs of his nation who were disbelievers
and who denied facing the Hereafter and whom We made affluent in the
worldly life, “This (man) is nothing but a human being. He eats from
what you eat from, and drinks from what you drink.</item>
        <item>If you obey a human like yourselves, then you will be
absolute losers.</item>
        <item>Does he promise you that, when you die and are turned
into dust and bones, you are to be brought forth?</item>
        <item>Far too improbable is what you are being promised.
</item>
        <item>There is nothing but our worldly life. We die and we
live, and we are not to be raised again.</item>
        <item>He is nothing but a man who has forged a lie against
Allah, and we are not going to believe in him.”</item>
        <item>He said, “My Lord, help me, for they have rejected
me.”</item>
        <item>He (Allah) said, “In a little while they will have to be
remorseful.”</item>
        <item>So the Cry seized them according to the true (promise),
and We turned them in to scum. So, away with the wrongdoing people.
</item>
        <item>Then, after them, We created another generation.</item>
        <item>No community can go ahead of its appointed time, nor can
they become late.</item>
        <item>Thereafter, We sent Our messengers successively.
Whenever its messenger came to a community, they rejected him. Then We
made some of them follow others (in destruction) and turned them into
tales (of history). So, away with a people who do not believe.</item>
        <item>Thereafter, We sent Musa and his brother Harun with Our
signs and a clear proof</item>
        <item>Towards Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his advisors. But they
showed arrogance and they were haughty people.</item>
        <item>So they said, “shall we believe in two humans who are
like ourselves and whose people are serving us as slaves?”</item>
        <item>Thus they rejected both of them and were among the
destroyed.</item>
        <item>And, of course, We gave Musa the Book, so that they may
take the right path.</item>
        <item>And We made the son of Maryam (Mary) and his mother a
sign, and gave them shelter on a height, having a place of rest and
running springs. ⁴</item>
        <item>O messengers, eat from the good things, and act
righteously. Of whatever you do, I am fully aware.</item>
        <item>Surely, this is your creed, a single creed, and I am
your Lord. So fear Me.</item>
        <item>But they split up ways from one another (dividing
themselves) into factions, each faction happy with what lies before
it.</item>
        <item>So leave them in their negligence for some time.</item>
        <item>Do they think that by consistently providing them with
wealth and children,</item>
        <item>We are accelerating the (real) good things to them? The
fact, however, is that they do not understand (the reality). ⁵</item>
        <item>Contrarily) those who are anxious out of awe of their
Lord,</item>
        <item>And those who believe in the verses of their Lord</item>
        <item>And those who do not associate any partner to their
Lord,</item>
        <item>And those who give whatever they give, with their hearts
full of fear that to their Lord they are to return ⁶</item>
        <item>Those people are accelerating towards the (real) good
things, and they are the foremost to attain them.</item>
        <item>We do not place a burden on anyone except according to
his ability. With Us there is a book which speaks with truth, and they
shall not be wronged.</item>
        <item>But their hearts are in ignorance about this, and they
have deeds, other than that, which they are continuously doing.
⁷</item>
        <item>Until when We will seize their affluent ones with
punishment, they will suddenly start crying.</item>
        <item>Then it will be said to them,) “Do not cry today. You
will not be helped by Us.</item>
        <item>My verses used to be recited to you, but you used to
turn back on your heels</item>
        <item>In arrogance, making it a subject of tales at night,
talking nonsense (about it).”</item>
        <item>Then, is it that they did not ponder over the Word (of
Allah), or there has come to them something that did not come to their
forefathers? ⁸</item>
        <item>Or did they not recognize their messenger and therefore
they denied him?</item>
        <item>Or do they say, “He is suffering from madness?” No, but
he has come to them with truth, but it is the truth that most of them
dislike.</item>
        <item>Had the truth followed their desires, the heavens and
the earth and all those therein would have fallen in total disorder.
However, We have brought to them their advice, but it is their advice
that they are averse to.</item>
        <item>Or is it that you (O Prophet) demand remuneration from
them? But the remuneration from your Lord is best, and He is the best
of all givers.</item>
        <item>Surely you are inviting them to a straight path,</item>
        <item>And those who do not believe in the Hereafter are surely
the deviators from the Path.</item>
        <item>And if We have mercy on them and remove whatever
distress they have, they would still persist obstinately in their
rebellion, wandering blindly (in disbelief).</item>
        <item>We have already seized them with punishment, but they
did not turn humble to their Lord, nor do they supplicate in humility,
⁹</item>
        <item>Until when We will open against them the door of a
severe punishment, they will be taken aback in despair.</item>
        <item>He is the One who created for you ears and eyes and
hearts. Little you are grateful.</item>
        <item>And He is the One who created you on the earth, and it
is He unto whom you will be gathered together.</item>
        <item>And He is the One who gives life and brings death, and
it is He who controls the alternation of night and day. So, do you not
understand?</item>
        <item>But they say as the earlier people had said.</item>
        <item>They said, “Is it that, when we will die and become dust
and bones - is it that we will be raised again?</item>
        <item>This is what has been promised to us and to our fathers
before. It is nothing but the tales of the ancients.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Whose is the earth and all those therein if you
have knowledge?”</item>
        <item>They will say, “Allah’s.” Say, “Would you still pay no
heed?</item>
        <item>Say, “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord
of the Great Throne?”</item>
        <item>They will say, “(All this belongs) to Allah”. Say,
“Would you still not fear Allah?”</item>
        <item>Say, “Who is the One in whose hand lies the kingdom of
every thing and who gives protection, and no protection can be given
against him, if you have knowledge?”</item>
        <item>They will say, “(All this belongs) to Allah.” Say, “Then
by which magic are you drawn crazy?”</item>
        <item>The fact is that We have brought to them The Truth, and
they are absolute liars.</item>
        <item>Allah has not taken a son to Himself, nor was there any
god with Him. Had there been so, every god would have taken away what
he created, and each one of them would have been aggressive against
the other. Pure is Allah from what they describe.</item>
        <item>He is the Knower of the hidden and the manifest. So, He
is far higher than their ascribing of partners to Him.</item>
        <item>O prophet) say (in prayer), “O my Lord, if You are to
show me (in my life) that (punishment) which they (the infidels) are
threatened with,</item>
        <item>Then, my Lord, do not place me among the wrongdoing
people.”</item>
        <item>And of course, We do have the power to show you that
with which We have threatened them.</item>
        <item>Repel evil with that which is best. We are well aware of
what they describe.</item>
        <item>And say, “My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the strokes
of the satans (devils),</item>
        <item>And I seek refuge in You, my Lord, even from their
coming near me.”</item>
        <item>The infidels go on doing their misdeeds) until when
death comes to one of them, he will say, “My Lord send me back,</item>
        <item>So that I may act righteously in that (world) which I
have left behind.” Never! It is simply a word he utters, and in front
of such people there is a barrier ¹⁰ till the day when they will be
resurrected.</item>
        <item>Thereafter, when the Sur (the trumpet) is blown, no ties
of kinship will remain between them any more, nor will they inquire
about one another. ¹¹</item>
        <item>So, the one whose scales (of good deeds) turn out to be
heavy, then such people are the successful ones,</item>
        <item>And the one whose scales turn out to be light, then such
people are the ones who harmed their own selves; in Jahannam (Hell)
they are to remain for ever.</item>
        <item>Fire will scorch their faces, and they will be
disfigured therein.</item>
        <item>It will be said to such people), “Were My verses not
used to be recited to you and you used to reject them?”</item>
        <item>They will say, “Our Lord, our wretchedness prevailed
over us, and we were a people wandering astray.</item>
        <item>Our Lord, get us out from here; if we do this again,
then of course, we will be transgressors.”</item>
        <item>He (Allah) will say, “Stay in it, humiliated, and do not
speak to Me.</item>
        <item>There was indeed a group of My servants who used to say,
‘Our Lord, we adhere to the (true) faith, so forgive us and have mercy
upon us, and you are the best of all the merciful.’</item>
        <item>But you made fun of them, so much so that they caused
you to forget My remembrance, and you used to laugh at them.</item>
        <item>Today I have so recompensed them for their observing
patience that they are the triumphant.”</item>
        <item>He (Allah) will say (to unbelievers), “How long did you
stay on the earth by number of years?”</item>
        <item>They will say, “We stayed for a day or for a part of a
day. So, ask those (angels) who have (exact) calculation.”</item>
        <item>He will say, “You did not stay but for a little. Would
that you had understood (this at that time)!</item>
        <item>So did you think that We created you for nothing, and
that you will not be brought back to Us?”</item>
        <item>So, High above all is Allah, the King, the True. There
is no god but He, the Lord of the Noble Throne.</item>
        <item>And whoever invokes another god with Allah, while he has
no proof for it, his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely, the
infidels will not achieve success.</item>
        <item>And say (O prophet) “My Lord, grant pardon and have
mercy, for you are the best of all the merciful.”</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>This is a Surah We have sent down and enjoined, and sent
down in it clear signs, so that you may receive the advice.</item>
        <item>The fornicating woman and the fornicating man, flog each
one of them with one hundred stripes. No pity for them should prevail
upon you in the matter of Allah’s religion, if you really believe in
Allah and the Last Day; and a group of believers must witness their
punishment.</item>
        <item>A man who is fornicator does not (like to) marry but a
woman who is a fornicator or a polytheist; and a woman who is a
fornicator does not (like to) marry but a man who is a fornicator or a
polytheist. And this (i.e. preferring to marry such spouses) has been
prohibited for the believers. ¹</item>
        <item>Those who accuse the chaste women (of fornication), but
they do not produce four witnesses, flog them with eighty stripes and
do not accept their any evidence any more. They are the sinners,
</item>
        <item>Except those who repent afterwards and mend their ways;
then, Allah is All-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Those who accuse their wives (of adultery) while they
have no witnesses except their own selves, ²then the evidence of one
of them would be to swear four oaths by Allah that he is truthful,
</item>
        <item>And the fifth (oath) that Allah’s curse be on him if he
is one of the liars.</item>
        <item>And it will remove the punishment from the woman if she
swears four oaths by Allah that he (the accuser husband) is certainly
one of the liars,</item>
        <item>And the fifth (oath) that Allah’s wrath be on her if he
is one of the truthful.</item>
        <item>Had it not been for the grace of Allah upon you, and His
mercy, and (had it not been) that Allah is Most-Relenting, All-Wise,
(you would have faced severe hardships).</item>
        <item>Those who have come up with the false imputation are a
gang among you. Do not think it is bad for you; rather, it is good for
you. Every one of them is liable for what he earned of the sin. And
the one who played the major role in it, for him there is a mighty
punishment. ³</item>
        <item>Why - when you (O believers) heard of it - did the
believing men and the believing women not think well about their own
selves, and (why did they not) say, “This is a manifest lie”.</item>
        <item>Why did they (the accusers) not bring four witnesses to
prove this? So, as they did not bring the witnesses, they are the
liars in the sight of Allah.</item>
        <item>Had it not been for the grace of Allah upon you, and His
mercy in this world and in the Hereafter, a severe punishment would
have reached you for what you indulged in -</item>
        <item>When you were welcoming it with your tongues, and were
saying with your mouths something of which you had no knowledge, and
were taking it as a trivial matter, while in the sight of Allah it was
grave.</item>
        <item>And why, when you heard of it, did you not say, “It is
not for us to speak about this. Pure are You (O Allah). This is a
terrible calumny.”</item>
        <item>Allah admonishes you never to repeat something like
this, if you are believers.</item>
        <item>Allah makes the signs clear to you, and Allah is AllKnowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who like that lewdness spreads among the
believers, for them there is painful punishment in this world and the
Hereafter. Allah knows, and you do not know.</item>
        <item>Had it not been for the grace of Allah upon you, and His
mercy, and that Allah is Very-Kind, Very-Merciful (you would have been
destroyed).</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not follow the footsteps of Satan.
Whoever follows the footsteps of Satan, (should know that) he orders
(one to commit) shameful acts and evil deeds. Had it not been for the
grace of Allah upon you, and His mercy, not a single person from you
would have ever attained purity. But Allah purifies whomsoever He
wills. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>The men of grace and wealth among you should not swear
against giving (their charitable gifts) to the kinsmen and the poor
and to those who have migrated in the way of Allah, and they should
forgive and forego. Do you not like that Allah forgives you? Allah is
Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful. ⁴</item>
        <item>Surely, those who level a false charge against the
chaste, naive and believing women are cursed in this world and the
Hereafter, and for them there is a mighty punishment</item>
        <item>On the Day when their tongues, their hands and their
legs will testify against themselves of what they used to do.</item>
        <item>On that day Allah will give them their rightful
recompense in full, and they will know that Allah is the Very Truth
who makes all things manifest.</item>
        <item>Vile women are for vile men, and vile men are for vile
women; and good women are for good men, and good men are for good
women. Those are free from what they (the accusers) say. For them
there is forgiveness, and a graceful provision.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not enter any houses, other than
your own houses unless you seek permission and greet their inmates
with Salam . That is good for you, so that you may be heedful.</item>
        <item>Even if you do not find anyone in them, do not enter
therein until permission is given to you. ⁵And if it is said to you,
‘Go back’, just go back; it is more decent for you. Allah is All-Aware
of what you do.</item>
        <item>There is no sin on you if you enter uninhabited houses
in which you have rightful benefit. ⁶Allah knows what you reveal and
what you conceal.</item>
        <item>Tell the believing men that they must lower their gazes
and guard their private parts; it is more decent for them. Surely
Allah is All-Aware of what they do.</item>
        <item>And tell the believing women that they must lower their
gazes and guard their private parts, and must not expose their
adornment, except that which appears thereof, ⁷ and must wrap their
bosoms with their shawls, and must not expose their adornment, except
to their husbands or their fathers or the fathers of their husbands,
or to their sons or the sons of their husbands,or to their brothers or
the sons of their brothers or the sons of their sisters, or to their
women ⁸, or to those owned by their right hands, or male attendants
having no (sexual) urge, or to the children who are not yet conscious
of the shames of women. And let them not stamp their feet in a way
that the adornment they conceal is known. And repent to Allah O
believers, all of you, so that you may achieve success.</item>
        <item>Arrange the marriage of the spouseless among you, and
the capable from among your bondmen and bondwomen. If they are poor,
Allah will enrich them out of His grace. Allah is All-Encompassing,
All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>And those who cannot afford marriage should keep
themselves chaste until Allah enriches them out of His grace. And
those of your slaves who wish to enter the contract of Kitabah
(emancipation by paying money), contract Kitabah with them, if you
recognize some good in them. And give them out of the wealth of Allah
that He has given to you. ⁹ And do not compel your maids to
prostitution - if they wish to observe chastity - in order that you
may seek the temporary benefit of the worldly life. If one compels
them, then after their being compelled, Allah is Most-Forgiving, VeryMerciful. ¹⁰</item>
        <item>Indeed We have sent down to you enlightening verses, and
an exemplary description of those who passed away before you, and a
good counsel for the God-fearing.</item>
        <item>Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The
example of His light is that of a niche, in which there is a lamp; the
lamp is in a glass - the glass looks like a brilliant star - it is lit
by (the oil of) a blessed tree, the olive, which is neither eastern,
nor western ¹¹. Its oil is about to emit light even though the fire
has not touched it - (it is) light upon light. Allah guides to His
light whomsoever He wills; Allah describes examples for the people,
and Allah knows everything well.</item>
        <item>The guided people worship Allah) in the houses that
Allah has permitted to be raised, and where His name is recounted and
His purity is pronounced, in the morning and in the evening,</item>
        <item>By the men whom no trade or sale makes neglectful of the
remembrance of Allah, nor from establishing Salah and paying Zakah ;
they are fearful of a day in which the hearts and the eyes will be
over-turned.</item>
        <item>The fate (of such people) is that Allah will reward them
for the best deeds they did, and will give them more out of His grace.
Allah gives whom He wills without counting.</item>
        <item>As for those who disbelieve, their deeds are like a
mirage in a desert plain, which a thirsty person deems to be water,
until when he comes to it, he finds it nothing, and finds (the decree
of) Allah with him, so He pays him his account in full. Allah is swift
at reckoning.</item>
        <item>Or (their deeds) are like layers of darkness in a vast
deep sea overwhelmed by a wave, above which there is another wave,
above which there are clouds - layers of darkness, one above the
other. When one puts forth his hand, he can hardly see it; and the one
to whom Allah does not give light can have no light at all.</item>
        <item>Did you not realize that purity of Allah is proclaimed
by all those in the heavens and the earth, and by the birds with their
wings spread out? Everyone knows one’s own (way of) praying (to Allah)
and one’s own (way of) proclaiming Allah’s purity. And Allah knows
well what they do.</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the
earth, and towards Allah is the final return.</item>
        <item>Do you not realize that Allah drives the clouds, then
joins them together, then turns them into a heap? Then you see the
rain coming out from their midst. He sends down from the sky mountains
(of clouds) having hail in them, then He afflicts with it whomsoever
He wills and turns it away from whomsoever He wills. The flash of its
lightning seems to snatch away the eyes.</item>
        <item>Allah alternates the night and the day. Surely, in that
there is a lesson for those who have eyes to see.</item>
        <item>Allah has created every moving creature from water. So,
some of them move on their bellies; and some of them move on two legs,
and some of them move on four. Allah creates what He wills. Surely,
Allah is powerful over everything.</item>
        <item>We have surely sent down enlightening verses, and Allah
guides whom He wills to the straight path.</item>
        <item>They say, “We have believed in Allah and in the
messenger, and have adopted obedience”, then a group from them goes
back after all this. Those are no believers. ¹²</item>
        <item>When they are summoned to Allah and His messenger that
he (the messenger) may judge between them, in no time a group of them
turns averse.</item>
        <item>And if the right is theirs, they would come to him as
(if they are) submissive ones.</item>
        <item>Is there a malady in their hearts or do they have doubt
or do they fear that Allah and His messenger will do injustice to
them? Rather they themselves are the unjust.</item>
        <item>The only reply of the (true) believers, when they are
summoned to Allah and His messenger that he (the messenger) may judge
between them, is that they say, “We listen and obey.” Such people are
the successful.</item>
        <item>Whoever obeys Allah and His messenger and has awe of Him
and observes Taqwa ¹³ for His sake, then such people are the
victorious.</item>
        <item>And they (the hypocrites) swear by Allah on forceful
oaths that if you (O prophet) order them, they will certainly leave
(their homes for Jihad ). Say, “do not swear, (the reality of your)
obedience is known. Indeed Allah is fully aware of what you
do.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Obey Allah and obey the messenger. But if you turn
away, then on him (the messenger) lies (the responsibility of) what he
is burdened with, and on you lies (the responsibility of) what you are
burdened with. And if you obey him, you will get the right path. The
duty of the Messenger is no more than to convey the message
clearly.”</item>
        <item>Allah has promised those of you who believe and do good
deeds that He will certainly make them (His) vicegerents in the land,
as He made those before them, and will certainly establish for them
their religion which He has chosen for them, and will certainly give
them peace in place of fear in which they were before; (provided that)
they worship Me, ascribing no partner to Me. And those who turn
infidel after that are the transgressors.</item>
        <item>Establish Salah and pay Zakah and obey the messenger, so
that you may be favored with mercy.</item>
        <item>Never think that the disbelievers are (able) to
frustrate (Allah’s plan) on the earth. Their abode is the Fire. Indeed
it is an evil terminus.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, the slaves owned by you, and those of
you who have not reached puberty, must seek your permission (to see
you) at three times: before the prayer of Fajr, and when you take off
your clothes at noon, and after the prayer of ‘Isha’. These are three
times of privacy for you. There is no harm, neither to you nor to
them, after these (three times). ¹⁴ They are your frequent visitors, as
some of you are (frequent visitors) of the others. This is how Allah
explains the verses to you. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>When the children from among you reach puberty, they
must seek permission, as the permission is sought by those before
them. This is how Allah explains His verses to you. Allah is AllKnowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>And those old women who have no hope for marriage, there
is no sin on them, if they take off their (extra) clothes while they
do not display their adornment. Still, that they refrain (even from
this) is better for them. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>There is no blame on a blind person, nor is there any
blame on any lame one, nor is there any blame on a sick person, nor on
yourselves in that you eat (something) from your own homes ¹³or from
the homes of your fathers or the homes of your mothers or the homes of
your brothers or the homes of your sisters or the homes of your
paternal uncles, or the homes of your paternal aunts or the homes of
your maternal uncles or the homes of your maternal aunts or from the
places the keys of which you have under your control, ¹⁶ or from (the
home of) your friend. There is no sin on you if you eat together or
separately. So when you enter homes, greet one another with SalÉm, a
greeting prescribed by Allah, which is blessed, pleasant. This is how
Allah explains the verses to you, so that you may understand.</item>
        <item>The believers are only those who believe in Allah and
His messenger and who, when they are with him for a collective matter,
do not leave unless they seek his permission. ¹⁷ Surely, those who seek
your permission are the ones who believe in Allah and His messenger.
So, if they seek permission from you for some business of theirs, give
permission to whom you wish from among them, and pray to Allah for
their forgiveness. Surely, Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Do not take the call of the messenger among you as a
call of one of you to another. ¹⁸ Allah definitely knows those of you
who sneak out hiding themselves under the cover of others. So, those
who violate his (messenger’s) order must beware, lest they are visited
by a trial or they are visited by a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>Remember! To Allah belongs all that is there in the
heavens and the earth. He knows the condition in which you are at
present; and the Day on which they will be returned to Him, He will
tell them what they did. Allah is fully aware of everything.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Glorious is the One who has revealed the Criterion ¹to
His servant, so that he may be a warner to all the worlds,</item>
        <item>The One to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and
the earth, and who did neither have a son, nor is there any partner to
him in the Kingdom, and who has created everything and designed it in
a perfect measure.</item>
        <item>Yet they have adopted other gods, beside Him, who do not
create any thing, as they themselves are created, and they possess no
power to cause harm or benefit even to themselves, nor do they have
any control over death or life or resurrection.</item>
        <item>The disbelievers said, “This is nothing but a lie he
(the messenger) has fabricated and some other people have helped him
in it.” Thus they came up with sheer injustice and falsehood.</item>
        <item>And they said, “(These are) the tales of the ancients he
(the messenger) has caused to be written, and they are read out to him
at morn and eve.”</item>
        <item>Say, “It is sent down by the One who knows the secret in
the heavens and the earth. Indeed He is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.
</item>
        <item>They said, “What sort of messenger is this who eats food
and walks in the markets? Why is it that an angel has not been sent
down to him who would have been a warner along with him.</item>
        <item>Or a treasure should have been thrown down to him, or he
should have a garden to eat from it?” And the transgressors said (to
the believers,) “You are following none but a bewitched man.”</item>
        <item>See how they coined similes for you, so they have gone
astray and cannot find a way.</item>
        <item>Glorious is the One who, if He so wills, would give you
better than that - gardens beneath which rivers flow, and would give
you palaces. ²</item>
        <item>But they have disbelieved the Hour (the Day of Judgment)
and for those who disbelieve the Hour, We have prepared a flaming
fire.</item>
        <item>When it will see them from a distant place, they will
hear (the sounds of) its raging and breathing,</item>
        <item>And when they will be thrown into a narrow place
therein, while they will be chained together, they will call for
death.</item>
        <item>Then it will be said to them,) “Do not call for one
death today, but call for many a death.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Is that better or the eternal paradise the Godfearing are promised?” It will be a reward for them and a final abode.
</item>
        <item>For them there will be whatever they wish, while they
will be eternal. This is a promise undertaken by your Lord, (the
fulfillment of) which is worth praying for.</item>
        <item>Remember) the Day when He will gather them and what they
used to worship beside Allah and will say (to the latter ones), “Did
you mislead these My servants, or did they themselves lose the
way?”</item>
        <item>They will say, “Pure are You. It was not for us to adopt
other guardians than You. Instead, You gave them and their fathers
(worldly) benefits till they forgot the advice, and became a ruined
people.”</item>
        <item>Thus they will refute you in what you say, and you will
not be able to repulse (the punishment,) or to receive help. Whoever
commits injustice from among you, We will make him taste a painful
punishment.</item>
        <item>We did not send any messengers before you (O prophet,)
but all of them used to eat food and walk in the markets. And We have
made some of you a test for some others. Would you observe patience?
And your Lord is Ever-seeing.</item>
        <item>Said those who do not even expect to meet Us, “Why the
angels are not sent down to us or why do we not see our Lord?” Indeed
they think too highly of themselves, and have gone too far in
rebellion.</item>
        <item>The Day they will see the angels, there will be no good
news for the sinners that day, and they will say, “(We need) a
shelter, fully protected!”</item>
        <item>And We will proceed to whatever deeds they did, and will
turn them into scattered dust. ³</item>
        <item>The people of Paradise, on that day, will be the best in
(terms of their) abode and best in (terms of their) resting-place.
</item>
        <item>The Day the sky will break open with a cloud, and the
angels will be sent down in a majestic descent,</item>
        <item>The Kingdom on that day will be for the Rahman (the AllMerciful, Allah), and it will be a difficult day for the disbelievers.
</item>
        <item>And (Be mindful of) the Day the wrongdoer will bite his
hands saying, “Would that I had taken a path along with the messenger!
</item>
        <item>Woe to me! Would that I had not taken so-and-so for my
friend!</item>
        <item>Indeed he led me astray from the advice after it had
come to me.” And the Satan is man’s betrayer.</item>
        <item>And the messenger will say, “O my Lord, my people had
taken this Qur’an as deserted.”</item>
        <item>In a similar way We made for every prophet an enemy from
among the sinners, but your Lord suffices as a guide and as a
supporter.</item>
        <item>Said those who disbelieved, “Why has the Qur’an not been
revealed to him all at once?” (It has been sent down) in this way
(i.e. in parts) so that We make your heart firm, ⁴and We revealed it
little by little.</item>
        <item>They bring to you no hypothesis, but We bring to you the
correct position and (an answer) better explained.</item>
        <item>Those who will be driven on their faces to Hell - they
are the worst in situation and far more astray from the path.</item>
        <item>Surely We gave Musa the Book, and appointed his brother
Harun as a minister with him.</item>
        <item>So we said, “Go, both of you, to the people who have
rejected Our signs” Then We annihilated them totally.</item>
        <item>As for the people of Nuh, when they rejected the
messengers, We drowned them and made them an example for mankind, and
We have prepared a painful punishment for the transgressors.</item>
        <item>And (We annihilated also the peoples of) ‘Ad and Thamud
and the people of Rass, ⁵and many generations in between them.</item>
        <item>To each (of them) We cited examples, and each of them We
brought to utter ruin.</item>
        <item>Indeed they (the pagans of Makkah) have passed by the
town that was afflicted by an evil rain sent down to it. ⁶So, have they
not been seeing it? Rather, they do not believe in Resurrection.
</item>
        <item>When they see you, they take you only as a laughing
stock, (saying) “Is this the man whom Allah has sent as a messenger?
</item>
        <item>He would have almost led us astray from our gods, had we
not been so firm towards them.” They will know when they will see the
punishment, who is farther astray in his way.</item>
        <item>Tell me about the one who has taken his desire as his
god, would you then, become a guardian for him?</item>
        <item>Or do you think that most of them listen or understand?
They are but like cattle. Rather, they are even farther astray from
the (right) way.</item>
        <item>Have you not observed how your Lord stretched out the
shadow (of the sun)? If He so willed, He would have made it stand
still. Then We made the sun an indicator for it. ⁷</item>
        <item>Then We pulled it toward Us in a gradual manner.</item>
        <item>He is the One who has made the night an apparel for you,
and the sleep a means of rest, and has made the day a means of
revival.</item>
        <item>And He is the One who has sent the winds conveying good
news before His mercy, ⁸and We have sent down purifying water from the
heavens,</item>
        <item>So that We revive a dead land therewith, and give drink
to the many cattle and humans created by Us.</item>
        <item>And We have distributed it (the water) among them, so
that they may take lesson. Yet most of the people refused all but
ungratefulness.</item>
        <item>Had We so willed, We would have sent a (separate) warner
for every town, (but, according to Our wisdom, We have sent Muhammad
as a prophet for all these towns)</item>
        <item>So, (O Prophet,) do not obey the infidels, and strive
against them with it (the Qur’an), in utmost endeavor.</item>
        <item>He is the One who joined the two seas, so as this is
sweet, very sweet, and this is bitter, very bitter, and made between
them a buffer and an insurmountable barrier.</item>
        <item>And He is the One who created man from water, then made
of him relations created by lineage and relations created by marriage.
Your Lord is All-Powerful.</item>
        <item>They worship, instead of Allah, what can neither give
them any benefit nor can cause them any harm. The disbeliever is
always a supporter (of Satan) against his Lord.</item>
        <item>We did not send you but as a bearer of good news and as
a warner.</item>
        <item>Say, “I do not demand from you any return, except that
one should adopt the (proper) way to his Lord, if he so wills.</item>
        <item>And place your trust in the Ever-Living who cannot die,
and proclaim His purity along with His praise. Enough is He to be
aware of the sins of His servants,</item>
        <item>The One who created in six days the heavens and the
earth and whatever lies between them, then He positioned Himself on
the Throne. (He is) the Rahman (the All-Merciful, Allah). So ask about
Him someone who knows.</item>
        <item>And when it is said to them, “Prostrate yourselves to
the Rahman (the All-Merciful, Allah),” they say “What is Rahman? ⁹Shall
we prostrate ourselves to the one to whom you direct us?” And it
increases nothing in them except aversion. ¹⁰</item>
        <item>Glorious is the One who made stellar formations in the
sky, and placed therein a lamp (i.e. the sun) and a bright moon.
</item>
        <item>And He is the One who made the day and the night
following each other, for the one who wishes to be mindful or wishes
to show gratitude.</item>
        <item>The servants of the Rahman (the All-Merciful, Allah) are
those who walk on the earth humbly, and when the ignorant people speak
to them, they reply peacefully,</item>
        <item>And those who pass the night prostrating themselves and
standing before their Lord,</item>
        <item>And those who say, “Our Lord, avert from us the
punishment of Jahannam (the Hell); indeed, its punishment is a
persisting affliction.”</item>
        <item>Indeed, it is evil as an abode and a place to dwell
in</item>
        <item>And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant
nor miserly, and it (i.e. their spending) is moderate in between (the
two extremes,)</item>
        <item>And those who do not invoke any other god along with
Allah, and do not kill a person whom Allah has given sanctity, except
rightfully, nor do they fornicate; and whoever does it, shall face the
recompense of his sin,</item>
        <item>The punishment will be doubled for him, and he will
remain there disdained, for ever,</item>
        <item>Except the one who repents and believes and does good
deeds, then Allah will replace the evils of such people by good deeds,
¹¹and Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Whoever repents and does righteous deeds turns to Allah
truly</item>
        <item>And those who do not witness falsehood, and when they
pass by the absurd things, Pass by them with dignity,</item>
        <item>And those who, when they are reminded of the verses of
their Lord, do not fall at them as deaf and blind ones,</item>
        <item>And those who say, “Our Lord, Give us, from our spouses
and our children, comfort of eyes, and make us heads of the Godfearing.” ¹²</item>
        <item>Such people will be rewarded with the high place -
because they observed patience - and will be received therein with
prayers of their eternal life and peace,</item>
        <item>Living in it (the Paradise) for ever. It is best as an
abode and as a place to dwell in.</item>
        <item>Say (O Prophet), “My Lord will never care about you, if
you will not invoke Him. Now since you rejected (the truth), the
punishment will be inseparable from you.”</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Sin mim. ¹</item>
        <item>These are the verses of the manifest Book.</item>
        <item>O Prophet,) perhaps you are going to let yourself
collapse in grief because they do not believe.</item>
        <item>If We so will, We can send down to them a sign from the
sky, for which their necks will stay bent in submission. ²</item>
        <item>Never a new message comes to them from the Rahman (the
All-Merciful Allah), but they become averse to it.</item>
        <item>Thus they rejected (the Truth); well, soon will come to
them the real descriptions of what they used to ridicule.</item>
        <item>Have they not looked at the earth, how many of the noble
pairs (of vegetation) We have caused to grow in it?</item>
        <item>Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are
not believers,</item>
        <item>And indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</item>
        <item>Remember) when your Lord called Musa saying, “Go to the
transgressing people,</item>
        <item>The people of Pharaoh. Do they not fear Allah?”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “My Lord, I fear that they will reject
me.</item>
        <item>My heart gets straitened, and my tongue is not fluent;
so send for Harun.</item>
        <item>Moreover, they have (leveled) a charge of offence
against me, ³and I fear they will kill me;”</item>
        <item>He (Allah) said, “Never! (They will not be able to kill
you.) So go, both of you, with Our signs. We are with you, listening
(to the conversation you will have with him.)</item>
        <item>So go, both of you, to Pharaoh and say, ‘We both are
messengers of the Lord of all the worlds,</item>
        <item>Sent with the message) that you must send the children
of Isra’il with us’”.</item>
        <item>He (Pharaoh) said, “Did we not nourish you among us as a
child? And you remained amidst us for years,</item>
        <item>And you did the blunder you did; still you are
ungrateful.”</item>
        <item>He said, “I did that at a time when I was mistaken.
</item>
        <item>Then I fled away from you when I feared you. Thereafter
my Lord granted wisdom to me, and made me one of the messengers.
</item>
        <item>As for the favor with which you are obliging me, it is
that you have enslaved the children of Isra’il.”</item>
        <item>Pharaoh said, “What is the Lord of the worlds?”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “Lord of the heavens and the earth and
whatever there is between them, if you are to believe”</item>
        <item>He (The Pharaoh) said to those around him, “Are you not
hearing?”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “Your Lord and the Lord of your early
forefathers”</item>
        <item>He (Pharaoh) said, “Your messenger who is sent to you is
a mad man indeed.”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “Lord of the East and the West and
whatever lies between them, if you are to understand.”</item>
        <item>He (Pharaoh) said, “If you adopt a God other than me, I
will certainly put you to prison.”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said “Will you (do this) even if I bring to
you something evident?”</item>
        <item>He said, “Then bring it, if you are truthful.”</item>
        <item>So, he threw down his staff, and in no time it was a
serpent, clearly visible,</item>
        <item>And he drew out his hand, and right then it was a white
light to the onlookers.</item>
        <item>He (Pharaoh) said to the chiefs around him “This man is
certainly an expert sorcerer”.</item>
        <item>He wants to expel you from your land with his sorcery.
So what do you suggest?”</item>
        <item>They said, “Leave him and his brother alone for some
time, and send heralds to the cities,</item>
        <item>So that they bring to you every highly expert
sorcerer.”</item>
        <item>So the sorcerers were assembled for the appointed time
of a known day,</item>
        <item>And it was said to the people, “Would you assemble,
</item>
        <item>So that we may follow the sorcerers if they are
victorious?”</item>
        <item>So, when the sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh, “Will
there be a sure reward for us, if we are the victorious?”</item>
        <item>He said, “Yes, and of course, you will then be among the
closer ones.”</item>
        <item>Musa said to them, “Throw you down what you are to
throw.”</item>
        <item>So they threw down their ropes and their staffs and
said, “By the majesty of Pharaoh, we will be the triumphant for
sure.”</item>
        <item>Then Musa threw down his staff, and in no time it
started swallowing the falsehood they invented.</item>
        <item>So the sorcerers were made (by the truth they saw) to
fall down in prostration.</item>
        <item>They said, “We have believed in the Lord of the worlds,
</item>
        <item>The Lord of Musa and Harun.”</item>
        <item>He (Pharaoh) said, “You have believed in him before I
permit you. Surely, he (Musa) is the chief of you all, who has taught
you sorcery. So you will soon know (your fate). I will cut off your
hands and feet from different sides, and will crucify you all
together.</item>
        <item>They said, “There is no harm. We will return to our
Lord.</item>
        <item>We really hope that our Lord will forgive us our faults,
as we are the first of the believers.”</item>
        <item>And We revealed to Musa saying, “Make My servants travel
at night. You will be pursued.” ⁴</item>
        <item>So Pharaoh sent into the cities (his) men to muster
(people)</item>
        <item>Saying, “These are a small band,</item>
        <item>And indeed they are enraging us,</item>
        <item>And we are a host, well-armed.”</item>
        <item>Thus We expelled them (i.e. the people of Pharaoh) from
gardens and springs,</item>
        <item>And from treasures and a noble abode. ⁵</item>
        <item>Thus it was. And We made the children of Isra’il inherit
all such things. ⁶</item>
        <item>So they (the people of Pharaoh) pursued them (the people
of Musa) at the time of sunrise.</item>
        <item>And when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of
Musa said, “Surely we are overtaken.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Never! Indeed with me is my Lord. He will
guide me.”</item>
        <item>So We revealed to Musa saying, “Strike the sea with your
staff.” So it was severed apart, and each part became like a big
mountain.</item>
        <item>Then We brought others close to that place.</item>
        <item>And We saved Musa and all those with him.</item>
        <item>Then we drowned the others.</item>
        <item>Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are
not believers,</item>
        <item>And indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</item>
        <item>And recite before them the narrative of Ibrahim,</item>
        <item>When he said to his father and to his people, “What do
you worship?”</item>
        <item>They said, “We worship idols, and stay devoted to
them.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Do they listen to you when you call (them)
</item>
        <item>Or do they bring benefit to you or harm?”</item>
        <item>They said, “No, but we have found our fathers doing like
this.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Have you then ever considered what you have
been worshipping,</item>
        <item>You and your ancient fathers,</item>
        <item>They all are an enemy to me, except the Lord of the
worlds,</item>
        <item>Who created me, and who guides me,</item>
        <item>And Who feeds me and gives me drink,</item>
        <item>And when I become sick, He heals me,</item>
        <item>And who will make me die, then will give me life,</item>
        <item>And who, I hope, will forgive my fault on the Day of
Retribution.</item>
        <item>O my Lord, give me wisdom, and make me join the
righteous,</item>
        <item>And destine for me a truthful description among the next
generations,</item>
        <item>And make me among those who will inherit the Garden of
Bliss,</item>
        <item>And forgive my father. Indeed he was one of those who
went astray,</item>
        <item>And do not put me to disgrace on the Day when all will
be raised to life,</item>
        <item>The Day when neither wealth will be of any use (to any
one) nor sons,</item>
        <item>Except to him who will come to Allah with a sound heart,
</item>
        <item>And the Paradise will be brought near to the Godfearing</item>
        <item>And the Hell will be fully uncovered for the perverse,
</item>
        <item>And it will be said to them, ‘Where is that which you
used to worship</item>
        <item>Beside Allah? Can they help you or help
themselves?’</item>
        <item>So they (their false gods) will be thrown on their faces
into it - they and the erring people</item>
        <item>And the entire army of Iblis (Satan), all together.
</item>
        <item>They will say when they will be quarreling there with
each other,</item>
        <item>By Allah, we were in open error</item>
        <item>When we used to equate you with the Lord of the worlds,
</item>
        <item>And it is only the sinners who misguided us.</item>
        <item>Now we have neither any intercessors</item>
        <item>Nor any true friend.</item>
        <item>Would that we have a chance to return whereby we may
join the believers!’”</item>
        <item>Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are
not believers,</item>
        <item>And indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</item>
        <item>The people of Nuh rejected the messengers</item>
        <item>When their brother Nuh said to them, “Do you not fear
Allah?</item>
        <item>I am an honest messenger for you.</item>
        <item>So, fear Allah and obey me.</item>
        <item>I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is
with none but with the Lord of the worlds;</item>
        <item>So, fear Allah and obey me.”</item>
        <item>They said, “Shall we believe in you while you are
followed by the lowest people?”</item>
        <item>He said, “I do not know about what they do;</item>
        <item>Their account is with none but with my Lord, if you have
sense.</item>
        <item>And I am not the one who would drive the believers away;
</item>
        <item>I am no more than a plain warner.”</item>
        <item>They said, “Should you not stop, O Nuh, you will surely
be stoned.”</item>
        <item>He said, “My Lord, my people have rejected me.</item>
        <item>So judge between me and them with an open verdict, and
save me and all the believers who are with me.”</item>
        <item>So We saved him and those with him in the Ark that was
fully occupied.</item>
        <item>Then We drowned, after that, all the remaining.</item>
        <item>Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are
not believers</item>
        <item>And indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Very-Merciful.
</item>
        <item>The (people of) ‘Ad rejected the messengers</item>
        <item>When their brother Hud said to them, “Do you not fear
Allah?</item>
        <item>I am an honest messenger for you,</item>
        <item>So fear Allah and obey me.</item>
        <item>I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is
with none but with the Lord of the worlds.</item>
        <item>Do you erect on every height a monument, having no sound
purpose, ⁷</item>
        <item>And take the objects of architecture ⁸as if you are going
to live forever,</item>
        <item>And when you seize (someone) you seize as tyrants?
</item>
        <item>So fear Allah and obey me.</item>
        <item>And fear the One who has supported you with what you
know.</item>
        <item>He has supported you with cattle and sons,</item>
        <item>And with gardens and springs.</item>
        <item>In fact I fear for you the punishment of a horrible
day.”</item>
        <item>They said, “It is all equal for us, whether you give us
advice or you do not become one of the advisors.</item>
        <item>This is nothing but the practice of the ancient,</item>
        <item>And we are not going to be punished.”</item>
        <item>Thus they rejected him, so We destroyed them. ⁹Surely, in
this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers,</item>
        <item>And indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</item>
        <item>The (people of) Thamud rejected the messengers</item>
        <item>When their brother Salih said to them, “Do you not fear
Allah?</item>
        <item>I am an honest messenger for you.</item>
        <item>So, fear Allah and obey me.</item>
        <item>I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is
with none but with the Lord of the worlds.</item>
        <item>Will you be left secure in whatever is here,</item>
        <item>In gardens and springs,</item>
        <item>And in farms and date-palms, the spathes of which are
interwoven?</item>
        <item>You hew out houses from the hills with pride.</item>
        <item>So fear Allah and obey me,</item>
        <item>And do not obey the order of the transgressors</item>
        <item>Who make mischief on the land and who do not set things
right”.</item>
        <item>They said, “You are merely one of those bewitched.
</item>
        <item>You are nothing but a human like us. So, bring a sign if
you are one of the truthful.”</item>
        <item>He said, “This is a she-camel. She has a share of water,
and you have a share of water on a specified day.</item>
        <item>So do not touch her with evil (intent), lest you should
be seized by a painful punishment.”</item>
        <item>But they killed her, then they became remorseful,</item>
        <item>And the punishment seized them. ¹⁰Surely, in this there
is a sign, but most of them are not believers,</item>
        <item>And indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</item>
        <item>The people of Lut rejected the messengers</item>
        <item>When their brother Lut said to them, “Do you not fear
Allah?</item>
        <item>I am an honest messenger for you.</item>
        <item>So fear Allah and obey me.</item>
        <item>I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is
with none but with the Lord of the worlds.</item>
        <item>Do you go to the males (for having sex) out of the whole
universe,</item>
        <item>And leave your wives whom your Lord has created for you?
Indeed you are a people who cross (all) limits.”</item>
        <item>They said, “If you do not stop O Lut, you shall be
included among the outcast.”</item>
        <item>He said “Indeed, I am annoyed with your act.</item>
        <item>My Lord, save me and my family from what they
do.”</item>
        <item>So We saved him and his family, all of them</item>
        <item>Except an old woman among those who remained behind.
</item>
        <item>Then We destroyed the others,</item>
        <item>And subjected them to a terrible rain. So evil was the
rain of those who were warned. ¹¹</item>
        <item>Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are
not believers,</item>
        <item>And indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</item>
        <item>The people of Aaikah ¹²rejected the messengers</item>
        <item>When Shu‘aib said to them, “Do you not fear Allah?
</item>
        <item>I am an honest messenger for you.</item>
        <item>So fear Allah and obey me.</item>
        <item>And I do not claim from you any reward for it; my reward
is with none but with the Lord of the worlds.</item>
        <item>Give full measure, and do not be among those who bring
loss to others.</item>
        <item>Weigh with an even balance,</item>
        <item>And do not make people short of their things, and do not
spread disorder in the land as mischief-makers,</item>
        <item>And be fearful of the One who created you and the former
generations.”</item>
        <item>They said, “You are but one of the bewitched men.</item>
        <item>You are no more than a human like us, and in fact we
consider you to be one of the liars.</item>
        <item>So cause a piece from the sky to fall down upon us, if
you are one of the truthful.”</item>
        <item>He said, “My Lord knows well what you do.”</item>
        <item>Thus they rejected him, so they were seized by the
torment of the Day of Canopy. ¹³Indeed it was the punishment of a
terrible day.</item>
        <item>Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are
not believers,</item>
        <item>And indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</item>
        <item>This (Qur’an) is the revelation of the Lord of the
worlds.</item>
        <item>The Trusted Spirit ¹⁴has brought it down</item>
        <item>Upon your heart, so that you become one of the
warners</item>
        <item>In plain Arabic language.</item>
        <item>And of course, it is (mentioned) in the Scriptures of
the former people. ¹⁵</item>
        <item>Is it not a proof for them that the knowledgeable of the
children of Isra’il recognize him (the prophet)? ¹⁶</item>
        <item>Even if We had revealed it to a Non-Arab,</item>
        <item>And he had recited it to them, they would not have
believed in it.</item>
        <item>This is how We have made it pass through the hearts of
the sinners. ¹⁷</item>
        <item>They will not believe in it until they will see the
painful punishment</item>
        <item>And it will come to them suddenly while they will not be
anticipating (it),</item>
        <item>And (then) they will say, “Is it (possible) that we are
given some respite?”</item>
        <item>Is it then Our punishment that they are trying to hasten
up?</item>
        <item>So tell me, if We give them enjoyment for years,</item>
        <item>Then comes to them what they are warned of,</item>
        <item>What help can they receive from the comforts they were
given to enjoy?</item>
        <item>We did not destroy any town unless it has had
warners</item>
        <item>To give advice, and We have never been unjust.</item>
        <item>And this (Qur’an) is not brought down by devils.
¹⁸</item>
        <item>It neither suits them, nor are they able to (do this).
</item>
        <item>In fact, they are kept far away from hearing (it at the
time of revelation).</item>
        <item>So do not invoke any other god along with Allah,
otherwise you will be among those who are to be punished.</item>
        <item>And warn the nearest people of your clan,</item>
        <item>And be kind with humbleness to the believers who
followed you.</item>
        <item>So if they disobey you, then say, “I disown what you
do,”</item>
        <item>And place your trust in the Mighty, the Merciful,</item>
        <item>Who sees you when you stand (in prayer,)</item>
        <item>And (sees) your movement among those who prostrate
themselves.</item>
        <item>Surely, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Shall I tell you on whom the devils descend?</item>
        <item>They descend on every sinful liar.</item>
        <item>They give ear to hear (secretly,) and most of them tell
lies.</item>
        <item>As for the poets, they are followed by the straying
people. ¹⁹</item>
        <item>Did you not see that they wander in every valley,</item>
        <item>And that they say what they do not? ²⁰</item>
        <item>Except those who believe and do righteous deeds and
remember Allah very much, and defend themselves after they are
wronged. ²¹And the wrongdoers will soon know to which place they are
going to return.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Ta Sin . ¹These are the verses of the Qur’an and an
enlightening book,</item>
        <item>A guidance and good news to the believers</item>
        <item>Who establish Salah and pay Zakah and who have faith in
the Hereafter.</item>
        <item>As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We
have made their deeds look beautiful to them. So they are wandering
astray.</item>
        <item>Those are the people who deserve the worst punishment
and who are the worst losers in the Hereafter.</item>
        <item>Indeed you are being given the Qur’an by a Wise,
Knowledgeable Being.</item>
        <item>Remember) when Musa said to his family, “I have noticed
a fire. I shall bring to you some news from it, or bring to you a live
ember, so that you may warm yourselves.”</item>
        <item>So when he came to it, he was called: “Blessed is the
one who is in the fire and the one who is around it. ²And pure is
Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</item>
        <item>O Musa, the fact is that I AM ALLAH, the Mighty, the
Wise.</item>
        <item>And cast your staff down.” So when he saw it moving, as
if it was a snake, he retreated turning his back, and did not look
behind. “O Musa, be not scared. I am such that the messengers are not
scared before Me,</item>
        <item>Except him who did wrong, then after (having done) evil,
replaced (it) with good, ³then I am Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.
</item>
        <item>And put your hand into your bosom, and it will come out
white, without any evil, as one of the nine signs (sent) to Pharaoh
and his people. Surely they have been a sinful people.</item>
        <item>So when Our signs came to them as eye-openers, they
said, “This is a clear magic.”</item>
        <item>And they denied them out of sheer injustice and
arrogance, though their hearts believed them (to be true). See, then,
how was the fate of the mischief-makers.</item>
        <item>Surely We gave knowledge to Dawud and Sulaiman, and they
said, “Praise belongs to Allah who made us excel many of His believing
servants.</item>
        <item>And Sulaiman inherited (the traits of) Dawud ⁴and said,
“O people we have been taught the speech of birds, and all sorts of
things are given to us. Indeed, this is the evident grace (of
Allah).”</item>
        <item>And mustered for Sulaiman were his forces from among the
Jinns and the humans and the birds. So all of them were kept under
(his) control,</item>
        <item>Until when they reached the valley of the ants, one of
the ants said, “O ants, enter your dwelling places, lest Sulaiman and
his armies crush you unknowingly.”</item>
        <item>So he (Sulaiman) smiled, laughing on her speech and
said, “My Lord, enable me to become grateful to Your favor that you
have bestowed on me and on my parents, and to do good deeds that You
like, and admit me, with Your mercy, among Your righteous servants.”
⁵</item>
        <item>And (once) he (Sulaiman) checked the birds and said,
“How is it with me that I do not see the hudhud (hoopoe)? Rather he
has disappeared.</item>
        <item>I will punish him with a severe punishment or slaughter
him unless he brings to me a clear plea.”</item>
        <item>Then the hoopoe did not take long and said (to
Sulaiman), “I have discovered what you did not, and have brought to
you a sure information from Saba’ (Sheba). ⁶</item>
        <item>I have found a woman ruling over them, and all sorts of
things are given to her, and she has a great throne.</item>
        <item>I have found her and her people prostrating themselves
to the sun, instead of Allah, and the Satan has beautified their deeds
for them, and has prevented them from the way, so they do not take the
right path,</item>
        <item>That is, they do not prostrate to Allah who brings forth
what is hidden in the heavens and the earth,__and who knows whatever
you conceal and whatever you reveal.”</item>
        <item>Allah! There is no god but He, the Lord of the Great
Throne. ⁷</item>
        <item>He (Sulaiman) said, “We shall see whether you have told
the truth or you are one of the liars.</item>
        <item>Go with this letter of mine, and deliver it down to
them, then turn back from them, and see how they react.”</item>
        <item>She (the queen) said (to her officials after receiving
the letter), “O chieftains, there has been delivered to me an esteemed
letter.</item>
        <item>It is from Sulaiman, and it is (in the following words
:) With the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Do not rebel against me, and come to me in
submission.”</item>
        <item>She said, “O chieftains, advise me in the matter I have
(before me). I am not the one who decides a matter absolutely unless
you are present with me.”</item>
        <item>They said, “We are powerful and tough fighters, and the
decision lies with you; so consider what command you should
give.”</item>
        <item>She said, “In fact when the kings enter a town, they put
it to disorder, and put its honorable citizens to disgrace, and this
is how they normally do.</item>
        <item>And I am going to send a gift to them, then see, what
response the envoys will bring back.”</item>
        <item>So when he (the envoy) came to Sulaiman, he said, “Are
you extending a financial aid to me? So what Allah has given me is
much better than what He has given to you. But you yourselves are
proud of your gift.</item>
        <item>Go back to them, and we will bring to them forces they
have no power to face, and we will certainly drive them out from there
in humiliation while they are disgraced.”</item>
        <item>He said, ⁸“O chieftains, which one of you will bring her
throne to me before they come to me submissively?”</item>
        <item>A stalwart of the Jinn said, “I will bring it to you
before you rise up from your place, and for this (task) I am powerful,
reliable.”</item>
        <item>Said the one who had the knowledge of the book, ⁹“I will
bring it to you before your glance returns to you.” So when he saw it
(the throne) well placed before him, he said, “This is by the grace of
my Lord, so that He may test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful.
Whoever is grateful is grateful for his own benefit, and whoever is
ungrateful, then my Lord is Need-Free, Bountiful”.</item>
        <item>He said, “Disguise the throne for her, and we will see
whether she discovers the truth, or she does not recognize it.”</item>
        <item>So when she came, it was said (to her), “Is your throne
like this?” She said, “It seems to be the same. We have been made to
recognize the truth even before this, and we have already submitted.”
¹⁰</item>
        <item>And she was prevented (from submitting before this) by
that which she used to worship instead of Allah. Indeed she was from a
disbelieving people.</item>
        <item>It was said to her, “Enter the palace.” Then once she
saw it, she thought it was flowing water, and uncovered her legs. He
(Sulaiman) said, “This is a palace made of glasses.” She said, “My
Lord, I had surely wronged myself, and now I submit, along with
Sulaiman, to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.”</item>
        <item>And We sent to Thamud their brother Salih saying (to
them), “Worship Allah”. Then suddenly they became two groups
quarrelling with each other.</item>
        <item>He said, “My people, why do you seek evil to come sooner
before good? Why do you not seek forgiveness from Allah, so that you
are treated with mercy?”</item>
        <item>They said, “We regard you and those with you as a sign
of bad omen.” He said, “Your omen is with Allah, but you are a people
put to a test.”</item>
        <item>And there were nine persons in the city who used to make
mischief on the earth and did not put things right.</item>
        <item>They said, “Let us swear a mutual oath by Allah that we
shall attack him (Salih) and his family at night, then will say to his
heir, ‘We did not witness the destruction of his family, and we are
really truthful.’”</item>
        <item>Thus they devised a plan, and We devised a plan, while
they were not aware. ¹¹</item>
        <item>So, look how was the fate of their plan, that We
annihilated them and their people altogether.</item>
        <item>Now those are their houses, lying empty because of their
transgression. Surely, in this there are signs for a people who have
knowledge.</item>
        <item>And We saved those who believed and who used to be Godfearing.</item>
        <item>And (We sent) Lut when he said to his people, “Do you
commit the shameful act while you can see (its shamefulness)?</item>
        <item>Is it that you really come to men lustfully instead of
women? No, you are a people committing acts of ignorance.”</item>
        <item>So, the answer of his people was not else but that they
said, “Expel the family of Lut from your town. They are a people who
over-indulge in purity.”</item>
        <item>So, We saved him and his family, except his wife. We
destined her to remain among those who stayed behind.</item>
        <item>And We rained on them a rain. So evil was the rain of
those who were warned. ¹²</item>
        <item>Say, “Praise belongs to Allah, and peace be on those of
His servants whom He has chosen.” Is Allah better or that which they
associate (with Him as His partners)?</item>
        <item>Or the One who created the heavens and the earth and
sent down for you water from the sky? Then We caused to grow with it
gardens, full of glamour. It was not within your ability to grow their
trees. Is there any god along with Allah? No, but they are a people
who equate (others with Allah).</item>
        <item>Or the One who made the earth a place to settle and made
rivers amidst it and made mountains for (making) it (firm), and made a
barrier between two seas? Is there any god along with Allah? No, but
most of them do not have knowledge.</item>
        <item>Or the One who responds to a helpless person when He
prays to Him and removes distress, and who makes you vicegerents of
the earth? Is there any god along with Allah? No, but little you heed
to advice.</item>
        <item>Or the One who guides you in depths of darkness on land
and sea, and who sends the winds bearing good news before His mercy?
Is there any god along with Allah? Allah is far higher than the
partners they ascribe to Him.</item>
        <item>Or the One who originated creation, then will reproduce
it, and who gives you provision from the sky and the earth? Is there
any god along with Allah? Say, “Bring your proof if you are
true.”</item>
        <item>Say, “No one in the heavens and the earth has the
knowledge of the Unseen except Allah.” And they do not know when they
will be raised again.</item>
        <item>Rather, their knowledge has failed in respect of the
Hereafter. Rather, they are in doubt about it. Rather, they are blind
to it.</item>
        <item>And said those who disbelieved, “Is it that, when we and
our fathers become dust,__is it that we shall really be brought forth?
</item>
        <item>Indeed, it was promised to us and to our fathers even
before this. This is nothing but the tales of the ancients.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Travel in the land and see how was the fate of the
sinners.”</item>
        <item>And do not grieve for them, nor should your heart be
straitened because of what they plan.</item>
        <item>They say, “When shall this promise come to pass if you
are true?”</item>
        <item>Say, “It is not unlikely that some part of that
(punishment) which you are asking to come soon is already following
you closely.”</item>
        <item>And surely, your Lord is graceful for the mankind, but
most of the people are not grateful.</item>
        <item>Of course, your Lord knows for sure what their hearts
conceal and what they reveal.</item>
        <item>There is nothing hidden in the heavens and the earth
that is not (recorded) in a manifest book.</item>
        <item>Surely this Qur’an mentions to the children of Isra’il
most of the matters in which they dispute.</item>
        <item>It is guidance and mercy for the believers.</item>
        <item>And surely your Lord will decide between them by His
judgment, and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>So trust in Allah. Surely you are on the clear truth.
</item>
        <item>Surely, you cannot make the dead to hear, nor can you
make the deaf to hear your call when they turn their backs in retreat,
</item>
        <item>Nor can you show the right path to the blind against
their wandering astray. You can make no one to listen (to you) except
those who believe in Our verses, then submit themselves (to Allah).
</item>
        <item>When the word will come to fall upon them, We will bring
forth for them a beast from the earth who will speak to them that the
human beings (i.e the infidels) did not believe in Our signs.
¹³</item>
        <item>And (remember) the day when We will gather from every
nation a host of those who used to reject Our verses, and they will be
kept under control.</item>
        <item>Until when they will come, He (Allah) will say, “Did you
reject My verses while you did not comprehend them with knowledge, or
what was it that you used to do?</item>
        <item>And the Word will come to fall on them because of their
transgression, so they will not (be able to) speak.</item>
        <item>Did they not see that We made the night, so that they
may have rest in it, and (made) the day to make them see? Surely, in
this there are signs for a people who believe.</item>
        <item>And (remember) the day when the Horn will be blown; so
all those in the heavens and the earth will be in panic, except those
whom Allah wills. ¹⁴And All (of them) will come to Him in humility.
</item>
        <item>And you see the mountains (at present) supposing them as
fixed (forever), while (on that Day) they will fly like the flight of
clouds - an act of Allah who has perfected every thing. Surely, He is
All-Aware of what you do.</item>
        <item>Whoever will come with the good deed will have (a
reward) better than that, and such people will be immune on that day
from any panic.</item>
        <item>And whoever will come with evil deed, the faces of such
people will be thrown down into the Fire. You will not be recompensed
but for what you used to do.</item>
        <item>I am but ordered to worship the Lord of this city, which
is sanctified by Him. And to Him belongs every thing, and I am ordered
to be one of the Muslims (who submit themselves to Allah),</item>
        <item>And to recite the Qur’an; so whoever takes the right
path, takes it for his own benefit. As for the one who goes astray,
say (to him), “I am only one of the warners.”</item>
        <item>And say, “Praise belongs to Allah. He will show you His
signs, then you will recognize them.” And your Lord is not unaware of
what you do.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Ta Sin Mim . ¹</item>
        <item>These are verses of the clear Book.</item>
        <item>We recite to you a part of the story of Musa and Pharaoh
with truth for a people who believe.</item>
        <item>Indeed, Pharaoh had become high-handed in the land, and
had divided its people into different groups; he used to persecute a
group of them, slaughtering their sons and keeping their women alive.
Indeed he was one of the mischief-makers,</item>
        <item>While We intended to favor those who were held as weak
in the land, and to make them leaders and make them inheritors,</item>
        <item>And give them power in the land, and to show Pharaoh,
Haman and their armies the very thing they were fearing from them.
²</item>
        <item>We inspired the mother of Musa ³saying, “Suckle him
(Musa). Then once you fear about him, cast him in the river, and do
not fear, and do not grieve. Surely We are going to bring him back to
you and appoint him one of (Our) messengers.”</item>
        <item>So the family of Pharaoh picked him up, so that he
becomes for them an enemy and a (cause of) grief. Indeed Pharaoh,
Haman and their armies were mistaken.</item>
        <item>And the wife of Pharaoh said, (to Pharaoh about Musa),
“He may be a delight of eye for me and you. Do not kill him. It is
hoped that he will be of benefit to us, or we will adopt him as a
son.” And they were not aware (of what was going to happen).</item>
        <item>And the heart of the mother of Musa became restless;
indeed she was about to disclose this (the real facts about Musa), had
We not strengthened her heart to remain among those who have firm
belief (in Allah’s promise).</item>
        <item>She said to his sister, “Keep track of him.” So she
watched him from a distance, while they were not aware.</item>
        <item>And We had already barred him (Musa) from (accepting)
any suckling women, ⁴so she (his sister) said (to Pharaoh’s people),
“Shall I point out to you a family who will nurse him for you, and
they will be his well-wishers?”</item>
        <item>Thus We brought him back to his mother, so that her eye
might have comfort and she might not grieve, and so that she might
know that Allah’s promise is true, but most of them do not know.
</item>
        <item>And when he reached his maturity and became perfect, We
gave him wisdom and knowledge. This is how We reward those who are
good in their deeds.</item>
        <item>Once he entered the city at a time when its people were
heedless; ⁵so he found in it two men fighting each other: This one was
from his own group, and that one from his enemies. So the one from his
own group called him for help against the one who was from his
enemies. So Musa gave him a blow with his fist and finished him off.
(Then) He (Musa) said (out of remorse), “This is some of Satan’s act.
He is indeed a clear enemy who misleads (people).”</item>
        <item>He said, “O my Lord, I have wronged myself, so forgive
me.” So He forgave him. ⁶Indeed He is the most Forgiving, VeryMerciful.</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “O my Lord! As You have favored me, I
will never be a supporter of the sinners.”</item>
        <item>Then next morning he was fearful in the city, waiting
(for what comes next) when the man who sought his help the day before,
shouted to him for help (again). Musa said to him, “You are surely a
clear trouble-maker.”</item>
        <item>Thereafter when he intended to grasp at the one who was
an enemy to both of them, he (i.e. the Israelite) said, “O Musa, do
you want to kill me as you have killed a person yesterday ? ⁷Your
intention is only to become a tyrant in the land, and you do not
intend to be one of the peace-makers.”</item>
        <item>And there came a man running from the farthest part of
the city. He said, “The chiefs are counseling each other about you, so
that they kill you. So, leave (the city). I am one of your wellwishers.”</item>
        <item>So, he went out of it (the city), looking around in a
state of fear. He said, “O my Lord, save me from the cruel
people.”</item>
        <item>When he set out towards Madyan, he said, “I hope my Lord
will guide me to the straight path”.</item>
        <item>And when he arrived at the waters of Madyan, he found a
large number of people watering (their animals) and found, aloof from
them, two women keeping (their animals) back. He said, “What is the
matter with you?” They said, “We cannot water (our animals) until
these shepherds take (their animals) back after watering them, and our
father is very old man.”</item>
        <item>So he (Musa) watered (their animals) for them, then he
turned to a shade and said, “My Lord, I am in need of whatever good
you send down to me.”</item>
        <item>Then one of the two women came to him, walking
bashfully. She said, “My father is calling you, so that he may give
you a reward for watering our animals. So when he (Musa) came to him
(the father of the women) and narrated to him the whole story, the
latter said, “Do not fear; you have escaped from the wrongdoing
people.”</item>
        <item>One of the two women said, “Dear father, hire him; the
best man you can hire is someone who is strong, trustworthy.”</item>
        <item>He (the father) said (to Musa), “I wish to marry to you
one of these two daughters of mine on condition that you act as my
employee for eight years. Then if you complete ten (years) it will be
of your own accord. And I do not want to put you in any trouble; you
will find me, Insha’allah (God-willing) one of the righteous.”</item>
        <item>He (Musa) said, “This is (done) between me and you.
Whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there should be no excess
against me, and Allah is witness to what we are saying.”</item>
        <item>So, when Musa completed the term and set forth with his
wife, he noticed a fire from the direction of (the mount) Tur, he said
to his wife, “Stay here; I have noticed a fire. ⁸May be I bring to you
some information or an ember from the fire, so that you may warm
yourself.”</item>
        <item>So when he came to it, he was called by a voice coming
from a side of the right valley in the blessed ground, from the tree,
saying, “O Musa, I AM ALLAH, the Lord of the worlds,”</item>
        <item>And saying, “Throw down your staff.” So when he saw it
moving as if it were a snake, he turned back in retreat, and did not
look back. (Allah said to him), “O Musa come forward and do not fear;
you are one of those in peace.</item>
        <item>Insert your hand into your bosom, and it will come out
white without any evil (disease), and press your arm to your side for
(removing) fear. ⁹Thus these are two proofs from your Lord (sent) to
Pharaoh and his chiefs. Indeed they are transgressing people.”</item>
        <item>He said, “My Lord, I have killed a person from them,
therefore I fear that they will kill me.</item>
        <item>And my brother Harun is more eloquent than me in speech;
so send him with me as a helper to bear me out. I am afraid, they will
give the lie to me.”</item>
        <item>He (Allah) said, “We will strengthen your arm with your
brother, and will give both of you such a power that they will have no
access to you (to cause any harm) because of Our signs. ¹⁰You and your
followers will be the victors.”</item>
        <item>So when Musa came to them with Our clear signs, they
said, “This is nothing but a forged magic, and we have never heard of
such a thing happening in the days of our forefathers.”</item>
        <item>Musa said, “My Lord is best aware of the one who has
brought guidance from Him and who is going to meet the best end of the
abode. ¹¹It is certain that the wrongdoers will not succeed.”</item>
        <item>And Pharaoh said (to his people,) “O courtiers, I do not
recognize any god for you other than me. So kindle for me, O Haman, a
fire on the clay (to bake bricks) and build for me a tower, so that I
may look on to the God of Musa. I deem him to be one of the
liars.”</item>
        <item>Thus) he and his hosts showed arrogance in the land with
no justification and thought that they would not be returned to Us.
</item>
        <item>So We seized him and his hosts and threw them into the
sea. ¹²Look then, how was the fate of the wrongdoers.</item>
        <item>We made them leaders who called (people) towards hell;
and on the Day of Judgment, they will not be helped.</item>
        <item>And We made a curse to pursue them in this world; and on
the Day of Judgment they will be among those dejected.</item>
        <item>And We gave Musa, after We destroyed the earlier
generations, the Book having insights for people and a guidance and
mercy, so that they may receive the advice.</item>
        <item>And (O prophet,) you were not there at the Western side
(of the mount Tur) when We delegated the matter to Musa, nor were you
among those present,</item>
        <item>But We created generations (after him) and a long time
passed over them. And you were not dwelling among the people of
Madyan, reciting Our verses to them, but it is We who do send
messengers.</item>
        <item>And you were not at the side of (the mount) Tur when We
called (Musa), but it (your prophet-hood through which you knew all
this) is a mercy from your Lord, so that you warn a people to whom no
warner has come before you, that they may receive the advice.</item>
        <item>And (We have sent you as a messenger) lest, in case they
suffered a calamity because of what their hands sent ahead, they
should say, “Our Lord, why did You not send a messenger to us, so that
we might have followed your verses and been among the
believers?”</item>
        <item>But when the Truth came to them from Us, they said, “Why
has he (the messenger) not been given (a book) similar to what Musa
had been given?” Is it not that they denied what Musa had been given
before? ¹³They said, “Both (Qur’an and Torah) are works of magic that
support each other.” And they said, “We disbelieve each one of
them.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Then bring a book from Allah which is better than
both, in guidance, and I shall follow it, if you are true.”</item>
        <item>So if they do not respond to you, be sure that they are
only following their desires. And who is more astray than the one who
follows his desire without guidance from Allah. Surely Allah does not
take the wrongdoing people onto the right path.</item>
        <item>And We have conveyed (Our) word to them one after the
other, so that they may receive the advice.</item>
        <item>As for those to whom We gave the Book before this, they
believe in it (Qur’an). ¹⁴</item>
        <item>And when this (Qur’an) is recited to them, they say, “We
believe in it. It is the truth from our Lord, and we are the ones who
had submitted (to it) even before it (was revealed).”</item>
        <item>Such people will be given their reward twice, because
they observed patience. ¹⁵And they repel evil with good, and spend from
what We have given to them.</item>
        <item>And when they hear absurd talk, they withdraw from it
and say, “Our deeds are for us and your deeds are for you. Peace be on
you. ¹⁶We do not desire (to be entangled with) the ignorant
people.”</item>
        <item>You cannot give guidance to whomsoever you wish, ¹⁷but
Allah gives guidance to whomsoever He wills, and He best knows the
ones who are on the right path.</item>
        <item>They said, “If we follow the guidance with you (O
Muhammad), we will be driven out of our land.” ¹⁸Is it not that We have
established them in the peaceful Haram (sanctuary) to which the fruits
of everything are drawn as a provision from Us? But most of them do
not know.</item>
        <item>And how many a town have We destroyed that were overproud of their means of living. Now, those are their habitations,
which were never inhabited after them except a few, and We alone were
the inheritors.</item>
        <item>And your Lord is not such as He would destroy the towns
unless he had sent to their central place a messenger who recites to
them Our verses, nor are We such as would destroy the towns unless
their people are wrongdoers.</item>
        <item>Moreover, whatever of anything you are given is (no more
than) an enjoyment of the worldly life and its decoration, and that
which lies with Allah is much better and far more lasting. So do you
not use reason?</item>
        <item>Is then the one, to whom We have made a good promise
which he is going to meet, like the one whom We have given the benefit
of enjoying the worldly life, then on the Day of Judgment he will be
among those arraigned?</item>
        <item>Remember) the Day when He will call them and say, “Where
are My ‘partners’ you used to claim?</item>
        <item>Those against whom the word will come true will say,
“Our Lord, these are the ones whom we led astray. We led them astray
as we ourselves went astray. We negate before you our responsibility
(in respect of them); it was not we whom they worshipped.” ¹⁹</item>
        <item>And it will be said, “Call those whom you held as cogods.” So they will call them, but they will not respond to them, and
they will see the punishment. Would that they had taken the right
path!</item>
        <item>Remember) the Day when He (Allah) will call them and
say, “What response did you give to the messengers?”</item>
        <item>So all events will become too obscure for them (to give
a correct reply), and they will not (be able to) consult each other.
</item>
        <item>As for the one who repents and becomes a believer and
acts righteously, hopefully he will be among the successful.</item>
        <item>Your Lord creates what He wills and chooses. Choice is
not theirs. Pure is Allah and far higher than their ascribing of
partners to Him.</item>
        <item>Your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they
reveal.</item>
        <item>And He is Allah. There is no god but He. Praise is only
for Him in the beginning and at the end, and He alone has the right to
judge, and to Him you are to be returned.</item>
        <item>Say, “Tell me, if Allah were to impose the night over
you, continuing forever up to the Day of Judgment, which god, other
than Allah, would bring to you light? Then, do you not listen?”</item>
        <item>Say, “Tell me, if Allah were to impose the day over you,
continuing for ever up to the Day of Judgment, which god, other than
Allah, would bring to you night in which you may have rest? Then, do
you not see?”</item>
        <item>And it is out of His mercy that He has made day and
night for you, so that you may have rest in it, and so that you may
search for His grace, ²⁰and so that you may be grateful.</item>
        <item>And (remember) the Day when He (Allah) will call them
(the disbelievers) and say, “Where are My ‘partners’ you used to
claim?”</item>
        <item>And We will draw out a witness from every community (to
prove their disbelief) and will say, “Bring your proof”. Then they
will know that truth is from Allah, and all that they used to forge
shall vanish from them.</item>
        <item>Indeed Qarun was from the people of Musa, ²¹then he
rebelled against them. And We had given to him such treasures as their
keys would weigh too heavy for a strong group of people. (Remember)
when his people said to him, “Do not exult. Surely, Allah does not
like the exultant.</item>
        <item>And seek the (betterment of) the Ultimate Abode with
what Allah has given to you, and do not neglect your share from this
world, and do good as Allah did good to you, and do not seek to make
mischief in the land. Surely, Allah does not like the mischiefmakers.”</item>
        <item>He said, “This is given to me because of the knowledge
(I have) with me.” Did he not know that Allah had destroyed, from the
generations before him, those who were stronger than him in power and
greater than him in multitude? And the sinners have not to be asked
about their sins. ²²</item>
        <item>Then (once) he came out before his people in his
embellishment. Said those who are desirous of the worldly life, “Would
that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! He is a man of
great fortune indeed.”</item>
        <item>And said those who were given knowledge, “Woe to you,
Allah’s reward is much better for him who believes and acts
righteously. But this is given to none but to those who observe
restraint.”</item>
        <item>Then We made him and his home sink into the earth. ²³So
there was no group for him who could help him against Allah, nor was
he one of those who could defend themselves.</item>
        <item>And those who wished to be in his position the day
before, started saying, “Oh, it seems that Allah extends provision to
whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Had Allah not favored
us, He would have made us sink (too). Oh, it seems that the infidels
do not succeed.”</item>
        <item>As for that Ultimate Abode (the Hereafter), We assign it
to those who do not intend haughtiness on earth nor mischief. And the
(best) end is for the God-fearing.</item>
        <item>Whoever brings good deed shall have better than it, and
whoever brings evil deed, then those who commit evils shall not be
punished except for what they used to do.</item>
        <item>Surely the One who has enjoined the Qur’an upon you will
surely bring you back to a place of return. ²⁴Say, “My Lord best knows
the one who has come with guidance and the one who is in manifest
error.”</item>
        <item>You were not expecting that the Book would be sent down
to you, but it was a mercy from your Lord. So, never be a supporter
for the infidels.</item>
        <item>And let them not prevent you from Allah’s verses after
they are sent down to you, and call (people) to your Lord, and never
become one of those who associate partners with Allah.</item>
        <item>And do not invoke any other god along with Allah. There
is no god but He. Every thing is going to perish except His Face. He
alone has the right to judge, and to Him you are to be returned.
</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Alif , Lam , Mim . ¹</item>
        <item>Do people think that they will be left (at ease) only on
their saying, “We believe” and will not be put to any test?</item>
        <item>Indeed We have tested those who were before them. So
Allah will surely know the ones who are truthful, and He will surely
know the liars.</item>
        <item>Or do those who commit evils think that they will
outstrip Us? Evil is what they predicate.</item>
        <item>Whoever hopes to meet Allah (must be sure that) Allah’s
appointed time has to come, and He is the All-Hearing, the AllKnowing.</item>
        <item>Whoever strives, strives for his own benefit. Surely
Allah is independent of all the worlds.</item>
        <item>Those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will
expiate their bad deeds and will give them a better reward (than their
expectation) for what they used to do.</item>
        <item>We have instructed man to do good to his parents. And if
they insist upon you that you should ascribe partners to Me, then do
not obey them. ²To Me is your return; then I shall tell you what you
used to do.</item>
        <item>And those who believe and do righteous deeds, We shall
include them among the righteous.</item>
        <item>Among men there are those who say, “We believe in
Allah”, but when they are persecuted in (the way of) Allah, they take
the persecution of men, as equal to the punishment of Allah. And
should any help come from your Lord, they will certainly say, “We were
with you.” ³ Is it not that Allah knows well what lies in the hearts
of the people of all the worlds? ⁴</item>
        <item>Allah will certainly know those who believe and He will
certainly know the hypocrites.</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieve say to those who believe, “Follow
our way, and we will bear the burden of your sins.” And they are not
(able) to bear the burden of their sins in the least. Indeed they are
pure liars.</item>
        <item>They shall certainly bear their own loads, and some
other loads along with their own loads, ⁵and they will certainly be
questioned about what they used to forge.</item>
        <item>We sent Nuh to his people. So he stayed with them one
thousand, less fifty, years. Then the Deluge seized them, and they
were transgressors. ⁶</item>
        <item>So We saved him and the people of the Ark, and made it a
sign for all the worlds.</item>
        <item>And (We sent) Ibrahim when he said to his people,
“Worship Allah and fear Him. That is better for you if you know.
</item>
        <item>You only worship idols beside Allah, and you invent a
lie. In fact those whom you worship beside Allah do not have power to
give you provision. So seek provision with Allah and worship Him and
be grateful to Him. To Him you are to be returned.</item>
        <item>And if you reject me, then many nations have rejected
their messengers before you. The messenger has no more obligation than
to convey the message clearly.”</item>
        <item>Did they not see how Allah originates the creation, then
He will do it again. Surely this is easy for Allah.</item>
        <item>Say, “Go about in the land and look how He has
originated the creation. Then Allah will create the subsequent
creation. ⁷Surely Allah is powerful to do everything.”</item>
        <item>He punishes whom He wills and has mercy on whom He
wills. And to Him you are to be turned back.</item>
        <item>You are not (able) to frustrate (Allah) neither in the
earth nor in the sky. And, apart from Allah, you have neither a
protector nor a helper.</item>
        <item>And those who deny the signs of Allah and meeting with
Him - those will despair of My mercy, and those are the ones for whom
there is a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>So, the response of his (Ibrahim) people was none but
that they said, “Kill him” or “Burn him”. So Allah saved him from the
fire. ⁸Surely in this there are signs for a people who believe.</item>
        <item>And he (Ibrahim) said, “You have adopted idols instead
of Allah, only because of love (you have) with each other in the
worldly life. ⁹Then on the Day of Judgment you will reject each other,
and will curse each other. And your abode is the Fire, and you will
have no helpers.”</item>
        <item>So Lut believed in him, and he (Ibrahim) said, “I am
going to leave my homeland towards my Lord. Surely He is the Mighty,
the Wise.</item>
        <item>And We granted him Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya‘qub (Jacob), and
assigned prophet-hood and Book to his progeny, and gave him his reward
in the world; and of course, in the Hereafter, he will be one of the
righteous.</item>
        <item>And (We sent) Lut when he said to his people, “Indeed
you commit the shameful act that no one in the worlds has ever
preceded you in it. ¹⁰</item>
        <item>Is it (not) a fact that you go for men (to satisfy your
lust) and rob the wayfarers and commit evil in your gathering?” So the
answer of his people was none but that they said, “Bring us Allah’s
punishment, if you are one of the truthful.”</item>
        <item>He said, “My Lord, help me against the people who make
mischief.”</item>
        <item>And when Our messengers came to Ibrahim with the good
news, they said, “We are going to destroy the people of this town.
Surely its people have been transgressors.”</item>
        <item>He said, “There is Lut in it.” They said, “We know well
who is in it. We will certainly save him and his family except his
wife who will be among those remaining behind.”</item>
        <item>And when Our messengers came to Lut, he grieved for them
and his heart was straitened because of them, ¹¹but they said, “We are
going to save you and your family, except your wife who will be among
those remaining behind.</item>
        <item>We are going to bring down on the people of this town a
punishment from the sky, because they used to act sinfully.”</item>
        <item>And We left from it (the town) an evident sign for a
people who understand.</item>
        <item>And (We sent) to Madyan their brother Shu‘aib. So he
said, “O my people, worship Allah and fear the Last Day, and do not
roam about in the land as mischief makers.”</item>
        <item>So they gave the lie to him, then they were seized by
the earthquake and they remained in their homes lying on their faces.
¹²</item>
        <item>And (We destroyed) ‘Ad and Thamud, ¹³and it is visible
to you through their dwellings. And the Satan had beautified for them
their deeds, so he prevented them from the (right) way, even though
they were people of insight.</item>
        <item>And (We also destroyed) Qarun ¹⁴and Pharaoh and Haman.
Indeed Musa came to them with clear signs; so they acted arrogantly on
the earth, and were not (able) to escape.</item>
        <item>Thus We seized each one of them for his sin. So to some
of them We sent a violent wind; and some of them were seized by a Cry;
and some of them We made to sink in the earth; and some of them We
drowned. And Allah was not to do injustice to them, but they used to
do injustice to their own selves.</item>
        <item>The example of those who have adopted patrons other than
Allah is like the spider that has made a house, while indeed the
weakest of houses is the house of the spider. If only they know.
</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah knows whatever thing they invoke beside
Allah, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.</item>
        <item>We site these examples for people, but no one
understands them except the knowledgeable ones.</item>
        <item>Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth.
Surely in this there is a sign for the believers.</item>
        <item>Recite (O Prophet) what is revealed to you of the Book,
and establish Salah . Surely Salah restrains one from shameful and
evil acts. Indeed remembrance of Allah is the greatest of all things.
Allah knows what you do.</item>
        <item>Do not debate with the people of the Book unless it is
in the best manner, except with those of them who commit injustice.
And say, “We believe in what is sent down to us and sent down to you,
and our God and your God is One, and to Him we submit
(ourselves).”</item>
        <item>Thus We have sent down the Book to you. So those to whom
We have given the Book believe in it. And from these (the people of
Makkah) there are ones who believe in it, and no one rejects Our
verses except the infidels.</item>
        <item>You (O Prophet,) have never been reciting any book
before this, nor have you been writing it with your right hand; had it
been so, the adherents of falsehood would have raised doubts. ¹⁵</item>
        <item>But it (the Qur’an in itself) is (a package of) evident
signs in the hearts of those who are given knowledge. And no one
rejects our verses except the wrongdoers.</item>
        <item>And they say, “Why is it that no signs (miracles) have
been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, “Signs are only with Allah,
and I am only a plain warner.”</item>
        <item>Is it not sufficient for them that We have sent down to
you the Book that is being recited to them? Surely in it there is
mercy and advice for a people who believe.</item>
        <item>Say, “Allah is enough as a witness between me and you.
He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. And those who believe
in falsity and do not believe in Allah,__those are the losers.</item>
        <item>They ask you to bring the punishment soon. Had there not
been an appointed time, the punishment would have come to them. It
will surely come to them suddenly while they will not be aware.</item>
        <item>They ask you to bring the punishment soon, while the
Jahannam is surely going to engulf the disbelievers</item>
        <item>On the Day when the punishment will envelop them from
above them and from under their feet and He (Allah) will say, “Taste
what you used to do.”</item>
        <item>O My servants who believe, surely My earth is vast. ¹⁶So,
Me alone you must worship.</item>
        <item>Every person has to taste death, then to Us you are to
be returned.</item>
        <item>As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, We
shall accommodate them in mansions of the Paradise beneath which
rivers flow, where they will live forever. Excellent is the reward of
the workers,</item>
        <item>Who observe restraint patiently and place their trust in
their Lord alone.</item>
        <item>How many an animal there is that does not carry its
provision. Allah gives provision to it as well as to you, and He is
the All-Hearing, the All-knowing.</item>
        <item>If you ask them as to who has created the heavens and
the earth and has subjugated the sun and the moon, they will certainly
say, “Allah”. How then are they driven aback (by their whims?)</item>
        <item>Allah extends provision to whom He wills from His
servants, and straitens it (for whom He wills). Surely Allah knows
every thing well.</item>
        <item>And if you ask them as to who sends down water from the
sky, then revives the land with it, they will certainly say, “Allah”.
Say, “Praise is for Allah.” But most of them do not understand.</item>
        <item>This worldly life is nothing but an amusement and play,
and the Last Abode is the real life indeed. Only if they know!</item>
        <item>So when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allah, having
their faith purely in Him. But when He saves them (and brings them) to
the land, in no time they start committing shirk (ascribing partners
to Allah),</item>
        <item>Thus becoming ungrateful for what We gave to them. Let
them have some enjoyment, then they will soon come to know (the illfate of their attitude).</item>
        <item>Did they not see that We have made a peaceful sanctuary
(Haram ) while (other) people around them are being snatched away? ¹⁷Do
they still believe in falsity and reject Allah’s grace?</item>
        <item>Who is more unjust than the one who forges a lie against
Allah or rejects the truth when it comes to him? Is there not in
Jahannam a home for disbelievers?</item>
        <item>As for those who strive in Our way, We will certainly
take them onto Our paths, ¹⁸and indeed Allah is with those who are good
in deeds.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Alif, Lam , Mim . ¹</item>
        <item>The Romans have been defeated</item>
        <item>in the nearer land; ³ and they, after their defeat, will
triumph</item>
        <item>within a few years. To Allah belonged the matter before
and (to Him it belongs) thereafter. And on that day the believers will
rejoice</item>
        <item>With Allah’s help. ³ He helps whomsoever He wills. And
He is the Mighty, the Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>It is a promise from Allah. Allah does not fail in His
promise, but most of the people do not know.</item>
        <item>They know something superficial of the worldly life, but
of the Hereafter they are negligent.</item>
        <item>Did they not reflect in their own selves? Allah did not
create the heavens and the earth and what is between them but with a
just cause and for an appointed time. ⁵ Yet many of the people are
disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord.</item>
        <item>Have they not traveled on earth to see how was the end
of those before them? They were stronger than these in power, and they
had tilled the land and had made it more populous than these have made
it, and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs. So Allah
was not such as could do injustice to them, but they used to do
injustice to themselves.</item>
        <item>Then the end of those who did evil was evil, because
they rejected the verses of Allah and used to make mockery of them.
</item>
        <item>Allah originates the creation, then He will create it
again, then to Him you are to be returned.</item>
        <item>On the day when the Hour (Qiyamah : the Day of
Judgement)) will take place, the guilty will be taken aback in grief
and despair.</item>
        <item>They will have no intercessors from among their (socalled) ‘partners of Allah’, and they themselves will reject their
(such) ‘partners’.</item>
        <item>And the day when the Hour (Qiyamah : the Day of
Judgement)) will take place__it will be on that day that they will
turn into separate groups.</item>
        <item>Then, those who had believed and had done righteous
deeds__they will be in a garden, extremely delighted.</item>
        <item>As for those who had disbelieved and rejected Our verses
and the meeting of the Hereafter, they will be brought for punishment.
</item>
        <item>So, proclaim Allah’s purity (from shirk) when you see
the evening and when you see the morning.</item>
        <item>And to Him be praise in the heavens and the earth, and
in the afternoon and when you enter the time of Zuhr (soon after the
decline of the sun towards West).</item>
        <item>He brings out the living from the dead, and brings out
the dead from the living, and gives life to the land after it is dead.
And in similar way you will be brought out (from graves).</item>
        <item>It is among His signs that He has created you from dust,
then soon you are human beings scattered around.</item>
        <item>And it is among His signs that He has created for you
wives from among yourselves, so that you may find tranquility in them,
and He has created love and kindness between you. Surely in this there
are signs for a people who reflect.</item>
        <item>And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and
the earth and the difference of your tongues and colors. Surely in
this there are signs for the persons having knowledge.</item>
        <item>And among His signs is your sleep by night and day, and
your search for His grace. Surely in this there are signs for a people
who listen.</item>
        <item>And it is among His signs that He shows you the
lightening which causes fear and hope, and that He sends down water
from the sky, then He revives the earth with it after its death.
Surely in this there are signs for a people who understand.</item>
        <item>And it is among His signs that the sky and the earth
stand firm by His command. Then, when He will call you from the earth,
by a single call, you will be coming out all at once. ⁵</item>
        <item>To Him belong all those in the heavens and the earth.
All (of them) are obedient to Him.</item>
        <item>It is He who originates the creation, then will create
it again; and it is easier for Him. His is the highest description in
the heavens and the earth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.</item>
        <item>He (Allah) gives you an example from yourselves: Do you
have, from among your slaves, any partners in the wealth that We have
given to you, so as they and you are equal in it, (and) so as you fear
them like you fear each other? ⁶ This is how We explain the signs for a
people who understand.</item>
        <item>But the wrongdoers have followed their desires without
knowledge. So who can guide the one whom Allah leaves astray? For such
people there are no helpers.</item>
        <item>So, set your face to the Faith uprightly, this (faith)
being the nature designed by Allah on which He has created the
mankind. There is no change in Allah’s creation. ⁷ That is the straight
faith, but most of the people do not know.</item>
        <item>Set your face to the Faith) turning totally towards Him,
and fear Him, and establish Salah, and do not be among those who
associate partners with Allah</item>
        <item>Among those who split up their religion and became
sects. Each group is happy with what it has before it.</item>
        <item>When the people are visited by some affliction, they
invoke their Lord with exclusive concentration on Him. Then once He
gives them a taste of His mercy, a group of them starts at once
ascribing partners to their Lord,</item>
        <item>So as to become ungrateful for what We gave to them. So
enjoy yourselves awhile; then you will soon come to know.</item>
        <item>Is it that We have sent down to them any authority that
speaks to them about their associating partners with Him?</item>
        <item>When We give people a taste of mercy, they are happy
with it, and if they are touched by an evil because of what their
hands sent ahead, they are at once in despair.</item>
        <item>Did they not see that Allah extends provision to
whomsoever He wills, and straitens (it for whomsoever He wills)?
Surely in this there are signs for a people who believe.</item>
        <item>So give to the kinsman his right, and to the needy and
the wayfarer. That is better for those who seek Allah’s pleasure, and
it is they who will be successful.</item>
        <item>Whatever Riba (increased amount) you give, so that it
may increase in the wealth of the people, it does not increase with
Allah; ⁸ and whatever Zakah you give, seeking Allah’s pleasure with it,
(it is multiplied by Allah, and) it is such people who multiply (their
wealth in real terms.)</item>
        <item>Allah is the One who created you, then gave sustenance
to you, then He will make you dead, then He will make you alive. Is
there any one from your (so-called) ‘partners of God’ who can do
anything of that (kind)? Pure is He, and far higher than what they
associate (with Him).</item>
        <item>Calamities have appeared on land and sea because of what
the hands of the people have earned, so that He (Allah) makes them
taste some of what they did, in order that they may return (to the
right way). ⁹</item>
        <item>Say, “Go about in the land, and see how was the end of
those who were before. Most of them were Mushriks (i.e. those who
ascribe partners to Allah)”.</item>
        <item>Then set your face to the straight Faith before the
arrival of a day that will never be repulsed by Allah. On that Day the
people will be split apart.</item>
        <item>Whoever disbelieves, his unbelief will be against him;
and whoever acts righteously, then such people are paving the path for
themselves,</item>
        <item>So that Allah may give reward, out of His grace, to
those who believed and did righteous deeds. Surely He does not love
the unbelievers.</item>
        <item>And among His signs is that He sends winds giving good
news (of rain), and so that He gives you a taste of His mercy, and
that the ships may sail with His command, and that you may search for
His grace, and you may be grateful.</item>
        <item>We had indeed sent before you messengers to their
people. So they came to them with clear proofs. Then We took vengeance
upon those who were guilty; and it was due on Us to help the
believers.</item>
        <item>Allah is the One who sends the winds, so they stir up a
cloud, then He spreads it in the sky however he wills, and makes it
(split) into pieces. Then you see the rain coming out from its midst.
So, once He makes it reach those whom He wills from His slaves, they
start rejoicing,</item>
        <item>Even though they were absolutely hopeless before it was
sent down to them.</item>
        <item>So, look to the effects of Allah’s mercy, how He gives
life to the earth after its death. Surely, That (Allah) is the One who
will give life to the dead; and He has the power to do everything.
</item>
        <item>Should We send a (harmful) wind, and they see it (the
tillage) turning yellow, then they will turn ungrateful, even after
all the aforesaid (bounties of Allah).</item>
        <item>So, you cannot make the dead to hear, nor can you make
the deaf to hear the call when they turn their backs in retreat.
</item>
        <item>Nor are you (able) to show the right path to the blind
against their straying. You can make none to listen except those who
believe in Our signs, hence they submit.</item>
        <item>Allah is the One who created you in a state of weakness,
then He created strength after weakness, then created weakness and old
age after strength. He creates what He wills, and He is All-Knowing,
All-Powerful.</item>
        <item>And on the Day when the Hour (Qiyamah : the Day of
Judgement) will take place, the sinners will swear that they did not
remain (in the graves) more than one hour. In the similar way they
used to be contrary (to truth in their worldly life).</item>
        <item>As for those who were given knowledge and belief, they
will say, “You remained, according to the destiny written by Allah, up
to the Day of Resurrection. So this is the Day of Resurrection, but
you had no belief.”</item>
        <item>So, on that Day, their apology will not benefit the
wrongdoers, nor will they be asked to repent.</item>
        <item>Indeed We have given in this Qur’an all kinds of
examples for the benefit of mankind. (Still) if you bring to them a
sign, the disbelievers will certainly say, “You are nothing but men of
falsehood.”</item>
        <item>Thus Allah seals up the hearts of those who do not
believe.</item>
        <item>So, be patient. Surely Allah’s promise is true, and let
not the disbelievers shake your firmness.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.

        <item>These are verses of the Wise Book,</item>
        <item>A guidance and mercy for those who are good in their
deeds</item>
        <item>Who are steadfast in Salah and who pay Zakah and have
faith in the Hereafter.</item>
        <item>It is these who are on guidance given by their Lord, and
it is just these who are successful.</item>
        <item>There is a man among the people who buys discourses of
distracting amusements, so that he may mislead (people) from the Way
of Allah, and make a mockery of it. ²For such people there is a
disgraceful punishment.</item>
        <item>And when Our verses are recited to him, he turns away in
arrogance, as if he did not hear them, as if there is heaviness in his
ears. So give him the ‘good’ news of a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>Surely, for those who believe and do righteous deeds
there are gardens of bliss</item>
        <item>In which they will live forever - an absolute promise of
Allah. He is the Mighty, the Wise.</item>
        <item>He has created the skies without the pillars that you
may see, and placed mountains on the earth, lest it shakes with you,
and spread over it all kinds of creatures. And We sent down water from
the heavens, and caused to grow in it every noble pair.</item>
        <item>This is the creation of Allah. Now, show me what is
created by those others, besides Him. Rather, the transgressors are in
open error.</item>
        <item>We gave wisdom to Luqman, ³and said, “Be grateful to
Allah;” and whoever is grateful is, in fact, grateful for his own
benefit, and whoever is ungrateful, then Allah is free of all needs,
worthy of all praise.</item>
        <item>Remember) when Luqman said to his son, while he was
advising him, “My dear son, do not ascribe partners to Allah. Indeed,
ascribing partners to Allah (shirk) is grave transgression.”</item>
        <item>We commanded man (to be good) in respect of his parents.
His mother carried him (in her womb) despite weakness upon weakness,
and his weaning is in two years. (We said to man,) “Be grateful to Me,
and to your parents. To Me is the ultimate return.</item>
        <item>However, if they force you to ascribe partners to Me
about whom you (can) have no (source of) knowledge, then do not obey
them. Remain with them in this world with due fairness, but follow the
way of the one who has turned himself towards Me. Then, towards Me is
your return, so I shall tell you what you had been doing.”</item>
        <item>Luqman went on saying to his son,) “My dear son, in
fact, if there be anything to the measure of a grain of rye, and it be
(hidden) in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring
it forth. Surely, Allah is All-Fine, All-Aware.</item>
        <item>My dear son, establish Salah , and bid the Fair and
forbid the Unfair, and observe patience on what befalls you. Surely,
this is among the matters of determination;</item>
        <item>And do not turn your cheek away from people, and do not
walk on the earth haughtily. Surely, Allah does not like anyone who is
arrogant, proud;</item>
        <item>And be moderate in your walk, and lower your voice.
Surely, the ugliest of voices is the voice of the donkeys.”</item>
        <item>Have you not seen that Allah has subjugated for you what
is in the heavens and what is on the earth, and has perfected His
blessings on you, both outward and inward? But among people there are
those who debate about Allah with no knowledge, no guidance and no
book to enlighten.</item>
        <item>When it is said to them, “follow what Allah has sent
down,” they say, “Instead, we would follow that on which we have found
our fathers.” Is it so, even though the Satan has been calling them to
the punishment of the flaming Fire?</item>
        <item>And whoever submits his self to Allah and is good in
deeds, he in fact holds on to the strongest ring. Towards Allah is the
ultimate end of all matters.</item>
        <item>And whoever disbelieves, let not his disbelief grieve
you. To Us is their return. Then We will tell them what they did.
Surely, Allah is All Aware of what lies in the hearts.</item>
        <item>We let them enjoy a little, then We will drag them to a
heavy punishment.</item>
        <item>And if you ask them as to who has created the heavens
and the earth, they will certainly say, “Allah.” Say, “Alhamdulillah ”
(Praise be to Allah). But most of them do not know.</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs what is in the heavens and the earth.
Surely, it is Allah who is free of all needs, worthy of every praise.
</item>
        <item>And if all trees that are on the earth were to be pens,
and the ocean (converted into ink) is supported by seven seas
following it, the words of Allah would not come to an end. ⁴Surely,
Allah is Mighty, Wise.</item>
        <item>Creation and resurrection of all of you is no more (to
Allah) than that of one single person. Surely, Allah is All-Hearing,
All Seeing.</item>
        <item>Did you not see that Allah makes the night enter into
the day, and makes the day enter into the night, and He has subjugated
the sun and the moon, each running towards an appointed time, and that
Allah is fully aware of what you do?</item>
        <item>That is because Allah is the only Real One and what they
invoke other than Him is false and Allah is the High, the Great.
</item>
        <item>Did you not see that the ships sail through the sea by
the grace of Allah, so that He shows you some of His signs? In that,
indeed, there are signs for every man of patience and gratitude.
</item>
        <item>And when they are covered by waves like canopies, they
pray to Allah, having faith exclusively in Him. Then, once He brings
them safe to the land, some of them remain balanced, ⁵(while others
turn ungrateful by denying Allah’s signs.) And no one denies Our signs
except every ungrateful traitor.</item>
        <item>O people, fear your Lord and fear a day when no father
will help his son, nor will a son be helpful to his father at all.
Surely, the promise of Allah is true. So, the worldly life must not
deceive you, nor should you ever be deceived about Allah by the
Deceiver. ⁶</item>
        <item>Surely, it is Allah with whom rests the knowledge of the
Hour; and He sends down the rain, and He knows what is in the wombs.
No one knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no one knows in which
land he will die. Surely, Allah is All Knowing, All Aware.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Alif Lam Mim. ¹</item>
        <item>This) revelation of the Book - in which there is no
doubt - is from the Lord of the worlds.</item>
        <item>Is it that they say, “He has fabricated it.”? No, it is
the truth from your Lord, so that you (O prophet,) may warn a people
to whom no warner has come before you; may be they take the right
path.</item>
        <item>Allah is the One who created the heavens and the earth
and all that is between them in six days, then He positioned Himself
on the Throne. Other than Him, there is neither a guardian for you,
nor an intercessor. Would you then not observe the advice?</item>
        <item>He manages (every) matter from the sky to the earth,
²then it (every matter) will ascend to Him in a day the measure of
which is one thousand years according to the way you count. ³</item>
        <item>That One is the All-knower of the Unseen and the seen,
the All-Mighty, the Very-Merciful,</item>
        <item>Who made well whatever He created, and started the
creation of man from clay.</item>
        <item>Then He made his progeny from a drop of semen, from
despised water.</item>
        <item>Then He gave him a proportioned shape, and breathed into
him of His spirit. And He granted you the (power of) hearing and the
eyes and the hearts. Little you give thanks.</item>
        <item>And they said, “Is it that when we disappear in the
earth__is it that we really come into a new creation?” Rather they are
ones who deny the meeting with their Lord.</item>
        <item>Say, “The angel of death who has been assigned for you
will take your soul in full, then you will be brought back to your
Lord.”</item>
        <item>And (you will wonder) if you see the sinners hanging
their heads before their Lord (and saying,) “Our Lord, we have now
seen and heard, so send us back, and we will do righteous deeds.
Surely, (now) we are believers.”</item>
        <item>And if We had so willed, We would have led everybody to
his right path (by force), but the word from Me had come to pass: “I
will certainly fill the Jahannam with jinn and human beings together."
⁴</item>
        <item>So, have a taste, because you had forgotten the meeting
of this day of yours. We have forgotten you; and taste the eternal
punishment for what you used to do.</item>
        <item>Only those people believe in Our verses who, when they
are reminded of them, fall in prostration and pronounce the purity and
praise of their Lord, and who do not wax proud. ⁵</item>
        <item>Their sides remain apart from their beds. They call
their Lord with fear and hope, and spend (in charity) out of what We
have given to them.</item>
        <item>So, no one knows the delight of eyes that has been
reserved for them in secret, as a reward of what they used to do.
</item>
        <item>So, can one who is a believer become like one who is a
sinner? They cannot become equal.</item>
        <item>As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, for
them there are gardens to dwell, as an honorable hospitality for what
they used to do.</item>
        <item>And the ones who disobeyed, their abode is the Fire.
Whenever they wish to come out from it, they will be turned back into
it, and it will be said to them, “Taste the punishment of fire that
you used to deny.”</item>
        <item>And We will certainly make them taste the nearer
punishment before the greater punishment, so that they may return.
⁶</item>
        <item>And who is more unjust than the one who was reminded of
the verses of his Lord, then he turned away from them. Surely, We have
to take vengeance upon the sinners.</item>
        <item>It is a fact that We gave the Book to Musa. So be not in
doubt about receiving it, ⁷and We made it a guidance for the children
of Isra’il .</item>
        <item>And We appointed leaders from among them who guided
(people) under Our command, when they observed patience, and kept firm
belief in Our verses.</item>
        <item>Surely, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of
Judgment in what they used to differ.</item>
        <item>Has it not been a source of guidance for them as to how
many generations We have destroyed before them who used to walk in
their dwellings? Surely in this there are signs. So, do they not
listen?</item>
        <item>Have they not seen that We drive water to the dry land,
then We bring forth crops thereby from which their cattle and they
themselves have food? So, do they not perceive?</item>
        <item>And they say, “When will this decision take place if you
are truthful (in your claim)?”</item>
        <item>Say, “On the day of decision their belief will not be of
any use to disbelievers, nor shall they be given any respite.”</item>
        <item>So, just ignore them (O prophet,) and wait. They (too)
are waiting.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>O Prophet, fear Allah and do not obey the disbelievers
and the hypocrites. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. Surely
Allah is All-Aware of what you do;</item>
        <item>And place your trust in Allah. Allah is enough as a
guardian.</item>
        <item>Allah has not made for any man two hearts in his chest
cavity, nor did he make your wives whom you subjected to zihar, your
mothers, nor did he make your adopted sons your (real) sons. ¹That is
(merely) a word uttered by your mouths. And Allah says the truth and
He shows the (right) way.</item>
        <item>Call them by (the name of) their (real) fathers; It is
more equitable in the sight of Allah. And if you do not know their
fathers, then they are your brothers in faith and your friends. There
is no sin on you in the mistake you make, but in that which you do
with intention of your heart; and Allah is Most-Forgiving, VeryMerciful.</item>
        <item>The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own
selves, and his wives are their mothers; and those having mutual
kinship are closer to one another (for the purpose of inheritance)
than (other) believers and emigrants according to the Book of Allah,
²unless you do some good to your friends (by making a will in their
favor). This had been written in the Book (the Preserved Tablet).
</item>
        <item>And (recall) when We took from the prophets their
covenant, and from you and from Nuh and Ibrahim and Musa and ‘Isa, the
son of Maryam, and We did take from them a firm covenant, ³</item>
        <item>So that He (Allah) may ask the truthful ones about their
truth. And He has prepared a painful punishment for the disbelievers.
</item>
        <item>O you who believe, remember Allah’s favor to you, when
the forces (of the infidels) came upon you, and We sent upon them a
wind, ⁴and the forces (of angels) you did not see. Allah is watchful of
whatever you do.</item>
        <item>Recall) when they came upon you from above you and from
below you, and when the eyes were distracted, and the hearts reached
the throats, and you were thinking about Allah all sorts of thoughts.
</item>
        <item>At that occasion, the believers were put to a trial and
were shaken with a violent convulsion.</item>
        <item>Remember) when the hypocrites and those having malady in
their hearts were saying, “Allah and His messenger did not promise us
but deceitfully;</item>
        "<item>And when a group of them said, “O people of Yathrib
(Madinah), there is no place for you to stay; so go back.” ⁵
And a group of them was seeking permission (to leave) from the
prophet, saying, “In fact our homes are vulnerable,” while they were
not vulnerable; they wanted nothing but to escape.</item>"
        <item>And if it (Madinah) is entered (by the enemy, in their
presence,) from all its sides and they are asked (to join) the
mischief, they would readily commit it, and would not remain in them
(their homes) but for a short while ⁶</item>
        <item>Despite that they had already made a covenant with Allah
that they would not turn their backs; and a covenant with Allah has to
be answered for. ⁷</item>
        <item>Say, “Flight will never be of any use to you, if you
flee from death or killing, and even then you will not be left to
enjoy (life) but for a little while.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Who is there to protect you from Allah, if He
intends evil to you, or (who is there to prevent Him) if He intends
mercy for you?” Beside Allah, they will not find for themselves either
a friend or a helper.</item>
        <item>Allah does know the ones from among you who prevent
(others from joining the battle) and those who say to their brothers,
“Come along with us,” and who do not come to the battle but for a
little while,</item>
        <item>And that too) with a greed against you (i.e. to extract
a share of spoils from you). But when fear comes, you will see them
looking towards you, rolling their eyes, like the one who gets faint
because of death. Then once fear is gone, they assail you with sharp
tongues, in greed for the good (i.e. the wealth acquired as spoils). ⁸
These people did not accept faith (in real terms), therefore Allah has
nullified their acts. ⁹ All this is so easy for Allah.</item>
        <item>They think that the coalition forces have not (yet)
gone. And should the coalition forces come (again), they would like to
be living in countryside among the Bedouins, asking (others) about
your news. And even if they were to remain among you, they would not
fight, but a little.</item>
        <item>There is indeed a good model for you in the Messenger of
Allah - for the one who has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and
remembers Allah profusely. ¹⁰</item>
        <item>When the believers saw the coalition forces, they said,
“This is what Allah and His messenger had promised to us, and Allah
and His messenger had told the truth.” It only improved them further
in faith and submission.</item>
        <item>Among the believers, there are men who came true to the
covenant they had with Allah. So, some of them have fulfilled their
vows (by sacrificing their lives in the way of Allah), and some of
them are (still) waiting, and they did not change (their commitment)
in the least. ¹¹</item>
        <item>All this happened) so that Allah may give reward to the
truthful ones for their truthfulness, and punish the hypocrites, if He
so wills, or accept their repentance. Surely, Allah is Most-Forgiving,
Very- Merciful.</item>
        <item>Allah has turned back the disbelievers with all their
rage, having achieved no good; and Allah sufficed the believers
against fighting. ¹²And Allah is Powerful, Mighty.</item>
        <item>He has brought those of the people of the Book (the
Jews) who had backed them, down from their fortresses, and cast awe
into their hearts, so as to make you kill some of them and take others
as captives;</item>
        <item>And He let you inherit their land and their homes and
their wealth, and a land you have not trodden (so far) ¹³. And Allah
is Powerful to do any thing.</item>
        <item>O prophet, say to your wives, “If you intend (to have
the pleasure of) worldly life and its charm, then come on, and I shall
give you some stuff, and release you in a handsome fashion; ¹⁴</item>
        <item>But if you intend (to gain the pleasure of) Allah and
His messenger and (the betterment of) the Hereafter, then, Allah has
prepared a great reward for those of you who are good in their deeds”.
</item>
        <item>O wives of the Prophet, whoever from among you will
commit a clearly shameful act, the punishment will be doubled for her;
and it is easy for Allah to do so.</item>
        <item>And whoever of you stays obedient to Allah and His
messenger, and acts righteously, We shall give her twice her reward,
and We have prepared for her a prestigious provision.</item>
        <item>O wives of the prophet, you are not like any other
women, if you observe taqwa (righteousness). So, do not be too soft in
your speech, lest someone having disease in his heart should develop
fancies (about you); and do speak with appropriate words.</item>
        <item>Remain in your homes, and do not display (your) beauty
as it used to be displayed in the days of earlier ignorance; and
establish Salah, and pay Zakah, and obey Allah and His messenger.
Allah only intends to keep (all sorts of) filth away from you, O
members of the family (of the prophet), and to make you pure through a
perfect purification.</item>
        <item>And be mindful of Allah’s verses and the wisdom that is
recited in your homes. Surely, Allah is All-Kind, All-Aware.</item>
        <item>Surely, Muslim men and Muslim women, believing men and
believing women, devout men and devout women, truthful men and
truthful women, patient men and patient women, humble men and humble
women, and the men who give sadaqah (charity) and the women who give
sadaqah, and the men who fast and the women who fast, and the men who
guard their private parts (against evil acts) and the women who guard
(theirs), and the men who remember Allah much and the women who
remember (Him) - for them, Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great
reward. ¹⁵</item>
        <item>It is not open for a believing man or a believing woman,
once Allah and His messenger have decided a thing, that they should
have a choice about their matter; and whoever disobeys Allah and His
messenger, he indeed gets off the track, falling into an open error.
</item>
        <item>Remember) when you (O Prophet,) were saying to the one
who was favored by Allah and favored by you, ¹⁶ “Keep your wife to your
self, and fear Allah.” And you were concealing in your heart what
Allah was going to reveal, and you were fearing people, while Allah is
more entitled to be feared by you. So, when Zaid finished his desire
for her, We gave her into your marriage, so that there may not be a
problem for the believers in marrying wives of their adopted sons,
when they finish their desire for them; and Allah\'s decree had to be
enforced.</item>
        <item>There is no problem for the prophet in (doing) what
Allah has prescribed for him, a customary practice of Allah in the
case of those who have gone before - and Allah’s command is predetermined by destiny -</item>
        <item>Those who convey the messages of Allah and have awe of
Him, and have no awe of anyone except Allah. Allah is sufficient to
take account (of everyone).</item>
        <item>Muhammad is not a father of any of your men, but he is a
messenger of Allah and the last of the prophets. ¹⁷ And Allah has the
Knowledge of every thing.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, remember Allah abundantly,</item>
        <item>And proclaim His purity at morn and eve.</item>
        <item>He is such that He and His angels send blessings to you,
so that He brings you out from all sorts of darkness into Light; and
He is Very-Merciful to the believers.</item>
        <item>Their greeting, on the Day when they will meet Him, will
be, “Salam ” ¹⁸. And He has prepared for them a noble reward.</item>
        <item>O prophet, We have sent you as a witness ¹⁹ and as a
bearer of good news and a warner,</item>
        <item>And as the one who calls (people) towards Allah with His
permission, and as a luminous lamp.</item>
        <item>So give good news to the believers that they are going
to receive a huge bounty from Allah;</item>
        <item>And do not obey the infidels and the hypocrites, and
just ignore any hurt (that afflicts you) from them, and place your
trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient (for you) to take care of all
matters.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, when you marry the believing women,
and then divorce them before you have touched them, then they have no
obligation of any ‘iddah (waiting period) for you that you may count.
So give them (due) benefits, and release them in a pleasant manner.
²⁰</item>
        <item>O prophet, We have made lawful for you all your wives
whom you have given their dowers, ²¹ and those (bondwomen) whom you
own, out of the captives Allah has given to you as spoils of war, and
daughters of your paternal uncle, and daughters of your paternal
aunts, and daughters of your maternal uncle, and daughters of your
maternal aunts, who have migrated with you, and a believing woman who
offers herself for (marrying) the prophet without dower, if the
prophet wishes to bring her into his marriage, these rules being
exclusive for you, and not for the (rest of the) believers, -- We know
what We have prescribed for them in respect of their wives and the
slave-girls they own -- so that there should be no difficulty for you.
Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>You may postpone (the turn) of any one you wish from
among them, and may accommodate with you any one you wish. And should
you recall any one from those whom you kept aside, there is no blame
on you. It is more likely, in this way, that their eyes will stay
content, and they will not grieve, and all of them will be happy with
whatever you give to them. ²² Allah knows whatever lies in your
hearts, and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>No women are lawful for you after this, nor is it lawful
that you replace them (the present wives) with other wives, even
though their goodness may attract you, ²³ except the bond-women you
own. And Allah is watchful of every thing.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the
Prophet, unless you are permitted for a meal, not (so early as) to
wait for its preparation. But when you are invited, go inside. Then,
once you have had the meal, just disperse, and (do) not (sit for long)
being keen for a chat. ²⁴ This (conduct of yours) hurts the Prophet,
but he feels shy of (telling) you (about it), but Allah is not shy of
the truth. And when you ask any thing from them (the blessed wives of
the Prophet), ask</item>
        <item>If you disclose any thing, or conceal it, Allah is AllKnowing about every thing.</item>
        <item>There is no sin for them (the wives of the Prophet) in
(appearing without hijab before) their fathers, or their brothers, or
the sons of their brothers, or the sons of their sisters, or their own
(Muslim) women, or their slave-girls. And (O wives of the Prophet,)
fear Allah. Surely, Allah is witness to every thing.</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah and His angels send blessings to the
Prophet. O you who believe, do pray Allah to bless him, and send your
Salam (prayer for his being in peace) to him in abundance.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger are
cursed by Allah in this world and in the Hereafter, and He has
prepared for them a humiliating punishment.</item>
        <item>As for those who hurt believing men and believing women
without their having done anything (wrong), they shall bear the burden
of slander and a manifest sin.</item>
        <item>O prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the
women of the believers that they should draw down their shawls over
them. That will make it more likely that they are recognized, hence
not teased ²⁵ And Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>If the hypocrites and those having malady in their
hearts and the ones who spread rumors in Madinah do not stop (their
evil deeds), We will certainly stir you up against them, then they
shall no longer live in it as your neighbors, but for a little while,
</item>
        <item>And that too in a state of being) accursed. Wherever
they are found, they shall be seized, and shall be killed thoroughly
²⁶</item>
        <item>A consistent practice of Allah in the matter of those
who have gone before. ²⁷ And you will never find a change in Allah’s
consistent practice.</item>
        <item>People ask you about the Hour (i.e. the Day of
Judgment). Say,” Its knowledge is only with Allah.” And what can let
you know? May be, the Hour is near.</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah has cursed the infidels, and has prepared
for them a flaming fire,</item>
        <item>Wherein they will live forever, finding no one to
protect or to help.</item>
        <item>The Day their faces will be rolled in the fire, they
will say, “Oh, would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the
Messenger!”.</item>
        <item>And they will say, “Our Lord, we obeyed our chiefs and
our elders, and they made us to go astray from the path.</item>
        <item>Our Lord, give them twice the punishment, and send a
curse on them, an enormous curse.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, be not like those who annoyed Musa,
then Allah cleared him of what they alleged; ²⁸ and he was honorable in
the sight of Allah.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, fear Allah, and speak in
straightforward words.</item>
        <item>If you do so,) Allah will correct your deeds for your
benefit, and forgive your sins for you. Whoever obeys Allah and His
Messenger achieves a great success.</item>
        <item>We did offer the Trust to the heavens and the earth and
the mountains, but they refused to bear its burden and were afraid of
it, and man picked it up. ²⁹ Indeed he is unjust (to himself), unaware
(of the end). ³⁰</item>
        <item>The result (of all this) is that Allah will punish the
hypocrites, men and women, and the Mushriks, men and women, and will
accept the repentance of the believing men and women. Surely Allah is
Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Praise be to Allah, to whom belongs all that is in the
heavens and all that is on the earth; and for Him is the praise in the
Hereafter, and He is the Wise, the All-Aware.</item>
        <item>He knows all that goes into the earth and all that comes
out from it, and all that comes down from the sky and all that ascends
thereto. He is the Very-Merciful, the Most-Forgiving.</item>
        <item>Said those who disbelieve, “The Hour (i.e. the Day of
Judgment) will not come to us.” Say, “Why not? By my Lord, the knower
of the Unseen, it will surely come to you.” Nothing in the heavens and
in the earth, even to the measure of a particle, can escape Him, nor
is there anything smaller than that or bigger, but it is recorded in a
manifest book. ¹</item>
        <item>The Hour will come, so that He rewards those who
believed and did righteous deeds. For such people, there is
forgiveness (from Allah) and a noble provision.</item>
        <item>As for those who strived against Our signs to defeat
(the messenger), for such people there is a painful punishment of the
divine wrath.</item>
        <item>Those who are blessed with knowledge see that what is
sent to you from your Lord is the truth, and it guides (people) to the
path of the All-Mighty, the Ever-Praised.</item>
        <item>And the disbelievers said, “Shall we point out to you a
man who informs you that, when you are totally torn into pieces, you
shall be (raised) in a new creation?</item>
        <item>Has he forged a lie against Allah, or is there a sort of
madness in him?” No, but those who do not believe in the Hereafter are
in torment and far astray from the right path.</item>
        <item>Have they not, then, looked to the sky and the earth
that lies before them and behind them? If We so will, We would make
the earth swallow them up, or cause pieces of the sky to fall upon
them. Surely, in this there is a sign for a servant (of Allah) who
turns to Him.</item>
        <item>Surely We bestowed grace on Dawud from Us: “O mountains,
pronounce with him Allah’s purity repeatedly - and you too O birds!”
²And We made the iron soft for him</item>
        <item>Saying to him, “Make coats of armour, and maintain
balance in combining rings, and do, all of you, righteous deeds.
Surely I am watchful of what you do.”</item>
        <item>And for Sulaiman (We subjugated) the wind; its journey
in the morning was (equal to the journey of) one month, and its
journey in the afternoon was (equal to the journey) of another month.
³And We caused a stream of copper to flow for him. And there were some
Jinns who worked before him with the leave of his Lord. Whoever of
them would deviate from Our command, We would make him taste the
punishment of the blazing fire. ⁴</item>
        <item>They used to make for him whatever he wished of castles,
images, basins as (large as) tanks, and big cookware fixed (in their
places). “Do good, O family of Dawud, in thankfulness. Very few from
My slaves are thankful.”</item>
        <item>So, when We decided (that) death (should come) upon him,
nothing gave them any indication of his death, except a creature of
the earth that had eaten up his sceptre. So, when he fell down, the
Jinns came to know that if they had the knowledge of the Unseen, they
would not have stayed (so long) in the humiliating punishment. ⁵</item>
        <item>There was indeed a sign for (the community of) Saba’ in
their home-land: two gardens, (one) on the right and (one) on the
left. ⁶“Eat of the provision from your Lord, and be grateful to Him -
(You have) an excellent city, and a Most-Forgiving Lord.”</item>
        <item>Then they turned away. So We sent to them the flood of
the dam, and replaced their two gardens with two gardens having fruits
of bitter taste, and tamarisk and some bushes of wild lotes.</item>
        <item>Thus We punished them because of their ungratefulness.
We do not give (such a) punishment but to the ungrateful.</item>
        <item>And We had set visible townships, all the way between
them and the towns blessed by Us, and phased the journey between them
in measured phases: “Travel along them at nights and days
peacefully.”</item>
        <item>Then they said, “Our Lord, make (the phases of) our
journeys more distant.” ⁷And they wronged themselves, therefore We
turned them into stories, and tore them into pieces. ⁸Surely in this
there are signs for everyone who is ever-patient, fully grateful.
</item>
        <item>Iblis (Satan)has found his assessment true about them.
So they followed him, except a group of the believers.</item>
        <item>He did not have any power over them, but for the reason
that We should recognize the one who believes in the Hereafter as
distinct from the one who is in doubt about it; and your Lord is
Watchful over every thing.</item>
        <item>Say. “Call upon those whom you claim (to be your gods)
beside Allah. They do not possess (any thing) even to the measure of a
particle, neither in the heavens nor in the earth. They have no
contribution at all in either of the two, nor is any of them a helper
for Him (Allah).</item>
        <item>Intercession before Him is of no benefit, but for the
one whom He has permitted. (And those who receive a command from Allah
remain fearful) until when fear is removed from their hearts, they say
(to each other), “What did your Lord say?” They say, “The Truth.” He
is the High, the Great.</item>
        <item>⁹Say, “Who gives you sustenance from the heavens and the
earth?” Say, “Allah”. And We or you are either on the right path or in
open error.”</item>
        <item>Say, “You will not be asked about the sins we committed,
and we will not be asked about what you do.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Our Lord will assemble us together, then will
judge between us with truth. He is the best Judge, the AllKnowing.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Show me the ones whom you have associated with Him
as partners. Never! (You can never produce such partners.) He is but
Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.”</item>
        <item>We did not send you (O prophet,) but to the entire
mankind, as a bearer of good news and as a warner, but most people do
not know.</item>
        <item>They say, “ When will this promise (of the Day of
Judgment) be fulfilled, if you are truthful?”</item>
        <item>Say, “You hold an appointment for a day that you can
neither put back for a while, nor can you put it forward.</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieve say, “We will never believe in this
Qur’an, nor in that which was before it.” But if only you could see
when the wrongdoers will be made to stand before their Lord, repulsing
words (of blame) to one another! Those who were held as weak will say
to the overbearing, “Had you not been there, we would have been
believers.”</item>
        <item>Those who were overbearing will say to those weak, “Had
we stopped you from (accepting) guidance after it came to you? Rather,
you yourselves were guilty.”</item>
        <item>And those weak will say to those overbearing, “But (it
was your) intriguing day and night (that stopped us from accepting
guidance), when you were directing us to disbelieve in Allah and to
set up rivals to Him.” And all of them will conceal (their) regrets
when they will see the punishment. And We will place iron-collars
around the necks of those who disbelieved. They will not be
recompensed except for what they used to do.</item>
        <item>We did not send a warner to a township, but said those
who lived a luxurious life in it, “We reject what you have been sent
with.”</item>
        <item>And they said, “We are superior in riches and children,
and we are not going to be punished”.</item>
        <item>Say, “In fact, my Lord extends provision to whom He
wills, and straitens (it for whom He wills), but most of the people do
not know”.</item>
        <item>Your riches or your children are not the things that
bring you near Us closely; however, the one who believes and acts
righteously (is close to Us). Therefore, such people will have the
double reward for what they did, and they will be at peace in the
upper chambers (of Paradise).</item>
        <item>As for those who strive against our signs trying to
frustrate (them), they will be arraigned into the torment.</item>
        <item>Say, “ Surely, my Lord extends provision for whomsoever
He wills, and straitens (it) for him. And whatever thing you spend, He
replaces it, and He is the best of the sustainers.</item>
        <item>Remember the Day when He will gather all of them
together, then will say to the angels, “Is it you that these people
used to worship?”</item>
        <item>They will say, “Pure are You! You are our mentor, not
these. Rather, they used to worship the Jinns. ¹⁰Most of these believed
in them.”</item>
        <item>So, you have no power today to benefit or harm one
another, and We will say to the wrongdoers, “Taste the punishment of
the Fire that you used to deny.”</item>
        <item>When Our evident verses are recited to them, they say,
“He is nothing but a man who wishes to divert you from what your
fathers used to worship.” And they say, “This is nothing but a forged
lie.” And the disbelievers say about the Truth, when it came to them,
“This is nothing but an explicit magic.”</item>
        <item>We did not give them any books that they might study,
nor did We send to them any warner before you.</item>
        <item>And those before them had rejected (the prophets), while
these (infidels of Makkah) have not reached even one tenth of what We
gave to those (before them). So, they rejected my Messengers. Then
(imagine) how was My censure!</item>
        <item>Say, “I advise you for one thing only: that you stand up
before Allah, in pairs and in singles, then reflect; (you will easily
appreciate that) there is no madness in your fellow (the Holy
Prophet).” He is none but a warner to you in the face of a stern
torment.</item>
        <item>Say, “If I had ever claimed any reward from you, then it
is yours. My reward is with none but Allah. And He is witness over
every thing.”</item>
        <item>Say, “My Lord sends forth the Truth. ¹¹ He is the BestKnower of the Unseen.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Truth has come, and falsehood (has vanished, and
it) has no power to produce or reproduce (anything).”</item>
        <item>Say, “If I go astray, I shall go astray only to my own
detriment. And if I follow the right path, it is because of what my
Lord reveals to me. Surely He is All-Hearer, Ever-Near.”</item>
        <item>And if you could only see when they will be terrified!
Then there will be no escape, and they will be seized from a place
near at hand.</item>
        <item>And they will say, “We believe in Him.” And how can they
grasp at it (the faith) from a place (so) far off, ¹²</item>
        <item>While they had rejected it before, and used to make
conjectures from a remote place?</item>
        <item>And a barrier will be placed between them and that which
they desire, as it will be done with the people of their kind who were
before (them). They have been in a perplexing doubt.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>All praise belongs to Allah, the Originator of the
heavens and the earth, who appoints the angels as messengers having
wings, in twos, threes and fours. He adds to the creation what He
wills. Indeed, Allah is powerful to do every thing.</item>
        <item>Whatever blessing Allah opens for the people, there is
none to hold it back, and whatever He holds back, there is none to
release it thereafter. He is the Mighty, the Wise.</item>
        <item>O mankind, remember Allah’s blessing upon you. Is there
any creator other than Allah who gives you provision from the sky and
the earth? There is no god but He. So, to where are you being turned
around (by your desires)?</item>
        <item>O Prophet, if they reject you, (it is not something new,
because) many messengers have been rejected before you. It is to Allah
that all matters are to be referred.</item>
        <item>O mankind, Allah’s promise is definitely true,
therefore, the worldly life must not deceive you, nor should you be
deceived about Allah by the big deceiver (Satan).</item>
        <item>Surely Shaitan (Satan) is an enemy for you. So, take him
as an enemy. He only invites his group (to falsehood) so that they
become inmates of the blazing fire.</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment; and
those who believe and do righteous deeds will have forgiveness and a
great reward.</item>
        <item>Then, can the one whose evil deed is so much adorned for
him that he deems it really good (be equal to the one who
differentiates between good and evil)? The fact, therefore, is that
Allah lets go astray whomsoever He wills, and leads to the right path
whomsoever He wills. So,(O Prophet) let not your soul collapse in
grief for them. Surely Allah knows well what they are doing.</item>
        <item>Allah is the One who sends the winds, then they raise up
the clouds, then We drive them to a dead land and revive the land
through them after its death. In similar way shall be the
Resurrection.</item>
        <item>Whoever desires honor, then all honor lies with Allah
alone. Towards Him ascends the pure word, and the righteous deed
uplifts it. ¹As for those who plot evils, for them there is a severe
punishment, and their plot itself will perish.</item>
        <item>Allah has created you from dust, then from a drop of
semen, then He made you couples. No female conceives (a baby) nor
gives birth (to it) without His knowledge; and no aged person is made
to advance in age, nor is a part curtailed from his age, but all this
is (recorded) in a book. Surely all this is easy for Allah.</item>
        <item>And two seas are not alike; this one is sweet,
saturating, pleasant to drink, and that one is salt, bitter. But from
each, you eat fresh meat, and derive ornaments that you wear. And you
see the boats therein cleaving through water, so that you may search
for His grace, ²and that you may be grateful.</item>
        <item>He makes the night enter into the day and makes the day
enter into the night, and He has subjugated the sun and the moon; each
one of them is running towards an appointed time. That is Allah, your
Lord. To Him belongs the kingdom. And those whom you invoke beside Him
do not own even the membrane on a date-stone.</item>
        <item>If you call them, they do not hear your call, and even
if they were to hear, they would not respond to you. And on the Day of
Judgment they will deny your having held them as Allah’s partners. And
none can inform you like Him who is Aware.</item>
        <item>O men, you are the ones who need Allah, and Allah is
Free-of-All-Needs, the Ever-Praised.</item>
        <item>If He so wills, He can do away with you and bring a new
creation.</item>
        <item>For Allah, that is not something difficult.</item>
        <item>No bearer will bear the burden of any other person. If a
person carrying a heavy load calls (someone) to (share) his load,
nothing from it shall be carried (by the latter), even though he be a
near of kin. You can warn only those who fear their Lord, while He is
unseen, and establish Salah. Whoever gets purified gets purified for
his own benefit. And to Allah is the final return.</item>
        <item>The blind and the sighted are not equal,</item>
        <item>Nor are darkness and light,</item>
        <item>Nor shade and heat of the sun.</item>
        <item>And the living and the dead are not alike. Allah makes
to hear whomsoever He wills. And you cannot make to hear those who are
in the graves.</item>
        <item>You are but a warner.</item>
        <item>Surely We have sent you with truth as a bearer of good
news and as a warner, and there was no community without a warner
having passed among them.</item>
        <item>If they reject you, (it is not something new, because)
those before them have (also) rejected (messengers). Their messengers
came to them with clear proofs and with scriptures and with the
enlightening book.</item>
        <item>Then I seized those who disbelieved. So, how was My
censure !</item>
        <item>Did you not see that Allah has sent down water from the
sky? Then We brought forth with it fruits having different colours.
And among the mountains there are tracks, white and red of different
colours and (others) utterly black.</item>
        <item>And among humans and beasts and cattle, there are those
having different colours as well. Only those of His slaves fear Allah
who are knowledgeable. Surely Allah is Mighty, Forgiving.</item>
        <item>Surely those who recite Allah’s Book and have
established Salah and have spent, secretly and openly, from what We
have provided to them -- they hope for a trade that will never crash,
</item>
        <item>So that He pays them their rewards in full, and gives
them more out of His grace. Surely He is Most-Forgiving, VeryAppreciative.</item>
        <item>The Book We have revealed to you is the Truth,
confirming what was (revealed) before it. Surely Allah, in respect of
His slaves, is All-Aware, All-Seeing.</item>
        <item>Then We conveyed the Book as an heritage to those of Our
slaves whom We chose. Now, some of them are those who wrong their own
selves, and some of them are mediocre, and some of them are those who
outpace (others) in righteous deeds with Allah’s permission. ³That is
the great bounty,</item>
        <item>Gardens of eternity they enter. They will be ornamented
with bracelets of gold and with pearls, and their dress therein will
be (of) silk.</item>
        <item>And they will say, “Praise be to Allah who has removed
all sorrow from us. Surely our Lord is Most-Forgiving, VeryAppreciative,</item>
        <item>Who, out of His grace, has made us land at a home of
eternal living where we are neither touched by weariness, nor are we
touched by boredom.”</item>
        <item>As for those who disbelieve, for them shall be the fire
of Jahannam; neither they will be sentenced to death, so that they
could die, nor will its torment be lightened for them. It is in this
way that We punish every infidel.</item>
        <item>And they will be crying therein, “Our Lord, take us out
(from here), and we will act righteously, not in the way we have been
doing before.” (Allah will say to them,) “Did We not give you an age
in your life in which lesson could have been learnt by the one who
wished to take lesson? And (furthermore) the warner had (also) come to
you. So, have a taste, because the wrongdoers will have no supporter.
</item>
        <item>Surely Allah is the Knower of the unseen in the heavens
and the earth. Indeed He fully knows what lies in the hearts.</item>
        <item>He is the One who has made you successors (of the past
generations) on the earth. So the one who becomes infidel, his
infidelity will go against himself. Their infidelity adds nothing to
the infidels but anger from their Lord, and their infidelity adds
nothing to the infidels but loss.</item>
        <item>Say, “Tell me about your (presumed) co-gods whom you
invoke beside Allah. Show me that part of the earth that they have
created. Or do they have a share in the (creation) of the heavens?” Or
have We given them a book so that they are upon a clear proof from it?
No, but the wrongdoers promise one another nothing but delusion.
</item>
        <item>Undoubtedly, Allah holds back the heavens and the earth
from leaving their existing state, and if they were to leave, there is
none who can hold them back, except Him. Surely He is Forbearing,
Most-Forgiving.</item>
        <item>They had sworn forceful oaths that if a warner would
come to them, they would be more receptive to guidance than any other
community. But when a warner came to them, it added nothing to them
but aversion,</item>
        <item>Because of their showing arrogance in the land and
plotting of evil. And the evil plot engulfs none but its own people
(who make it). So, they are looking for nothing but the (divine)
practice with the earlier people. So you will never find in Allah’s
practice any change, and you will never find in Allah’s practice any
diversion.</item>
        <item>Did they not travel in the land and see how was the end
of those before them? They were stronger than these in power. Allah is
not such that something in the heavens or the earth can frustrate Him.
Surely He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.</item>
        <item>If Allah were to take mankind to task for what they did,
He would have not left a living creature on its back, but He delays
them upto an appointed time. So when their time will come, then Allah
is the One who will see His slaves.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Ya Sin ¹</item>
        <item>By the Qur’an, that is full of wisdom,</item>
        <item>You are truly one of the messengers of Allah,</item>
        <item>And you are) on a straight path</item>
        <item>This Qur’an being) a revelation from the All- Mighty,
the Very-Merciful,</item>
        <item>So that you may warn a people whose fathers were not
warned, and hence, they are unaware.</item>
        <item>The word has indeed come true about most of them, so
they will not believe. ²</item>
        <item>We have placed iron collars on their necks, so they are
reaching up to their chins, and their heads are forced to remain
upwards. ³</item>
        <item>And We have placed a barrier in front of them and a
barrier behind them, and (thus) they are encircled by Us; so they do
not see.</item>
        <item>It is all equal for them whether you warn them or do not
warn them, they will not believe.</item>
        <item>You can (usefully) warn only the one who follows the
advice and fears the Rahman (the All-Merciful Allah) without seeing
(Him). So give him the good news of forgiveness and of a noble reward.
</item>
        <item>Surely We will give new life to the dead, and We are
recording whatever (deeds) they send before them and whatever effects
they leave behind. Every thing is fully computed by Us in a manifest
book of record.</item>
        <item>Cite to them the example of the People of the Town, when
the messengers came to it, ⁴</item>
        <item>When We sent to them two (apostles), and they rejected
both of them, so We confirmed them with a third one. So they said, “We
are sent to you.”</item>
        <item>They (the people of the Town) said, “You are no more
than human beings like us, and the Rahman (the All-Merciful Allah) has
not sent down any thing. You are but telling a lie.”</item>
        <item>They (the messengers) said, “Our Lord knows that we are
undoubtedly sent to you.</item>
        <item>Our obligation is no more than to convey the message
clearly.”</item>
        <item>They (the People of the Town) said, “We take you as a
bad omen for us. If you do not desist, we will certainly stone you and
you will be afflicted by a painful punishment from us.”</item>
        <item>They said, “Your bad omen is with yourselves. (Do you
take it as bad omen) if you are given a good counsel? Rather, you are
a people who cross all limits.”</item>
        <item>And there came a man rushing from the farthest part of
the city. ⁵He said, “O my people, follow the messengers.</item>
        <item>Follow those who do not claim any reward from you, and
who are on the right path.</item>
        <item>What excuse do I have if I do not worship the One who
has created me and to whom you will be returned?</item>
        <item>Shall I adopt those gods besides Him whose intercession,
if Rahman (the All-Merciful Allah) intends to do harm to me, cannot
help me in the least, nor can they come to my rescue?</item>
        <item>In that case, I will be in open error indeed.</item>
        <item>Undoubtedly I have believed in your Lord; so listen to
me.”</item>
        <item>Thereafter when his people killed him,) it was said to
him, “Enter the Paradise”. He said, “Would that my people knew</item>
        <item>How my Lord has forgiven me and placed me among the
honoured ones!”</item>
        <item>And We did not send down to his people any army from the
heavens after him, nor were We (in need) to send down. ⁶</item>
        <item>It was no more than a single Cry, and in no time they
were extinguished.</item>
        <item>Alas for the slaves (of Allah)! No messenger came to
them, but they have been mocking at him.</item>
        <item>Did they not see how many generations We have destroyed
before them who will not come back to them?</item>
        <item>All of them are but to be assembled together (and) to be
arraigned before Us.</item>
        <item>And a sign for them is the dead land. We gave it life
and brought forth grain from it; so from it they eat.</item>
        <item>And We have placed gardens of date-palms and grapes, and
caused springs to gush forth therein,</item>
        <item>So that they may eat fruits thereof, while it was not
made by their hands. Would they not then offer gratitude?</item>
        <item>Pure (from every fault) is the One who has created all
the pairs of whatever the earth grows and of the humans themselves and
of that which they do not know. ⁷</item>
        <item>And a sign for them is the night. We strip (the cover
of) the day from it, and they are suddenly in darkness.</item>
        <item>And the sun is quickly proceeding towards its
destination. That is the designing of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.
</item>
        <item>And for the moon We have appointed measured phases,
until it turned (pale, curved and fine) like an old branch of date
palm.</item>
        <item>Neither it is for the sun to overtake the moon, nor can
the night outpace the day. Each one is floating in an orbit.</item>
        <item>And it is a sign for them that We boarded their children
in the loaded ship, ⁸</item>
        <item>And created for them things similar to it on which they
ride. ⁹</item>
        <item>And if We so will, We can drown them; then no one will
respond to their cry, nor will they be rescued,</item>
        <item>Unless there be mercy from Us, and (unless) We let them
enjoy for a while.</item>
        <item>And (they pay no heed) when it is said to them, “Save
yourselves from that (punishment) which is before you (in this world)
and that which will come after you (die), so that you may receive
mercy”.</item>
        <item>There comes to them no sign from the signs of your Lord,
but they turn averse to it.</item>
        <item>And when it is said to them, “Spend (to the needy) from
the provision Allah has given to you”, the disbelievers say to the
believers, “Shall we feed those whom Allah could have fed, if Allah so
willed? You are but in open error.”</item>
        <item>And they say, “When will this promise come true, if you
are truthful?”</item>
        <item>They are looking for nothing but for a single Cry that
will seize them when they will be quarrelling.</item>
        <item>So they will not be able to make a bequest, nor will
they return to their household.</item>
        <item>And the Horn will be blown, and suddenly they will be
rushing from their graves towards their Lord.</item>
        <item>They will say, “Woe to us! Who has raised us from our
sleeping place? “This is what Rahman (the All-Merciful Allah) had
promised, and the messengers had told the truth.</item>
        <item>It will be no more than a single Cry, and in no time
they will all be arraigned before Us.</item>
        <item>Then, nobody will be subjected to injustice in the
least, and you will not be recompensed but for what you used to do.
</item>
        <item>The people of the Paradise are engaged today in (their)
activities, happily enjoying (them).</item>
        <item>They and their spouses are in pleasant shades, reclining
on couches.</item>
        <item>For them there are fruits, and for them there is
whatever they ask for.</item>
        <item>Salam ”(Peace upon you) is the word (they receive) from
Merciful Lord.</item>
        <item>And (it will be said to the infidels,) “Get apart (from
the believers) today O the guilty ones.</item>
        <item>Did I not direct you, O children of ’Adam (Adam), that
you must not worship the Satan, (because) he is an open enemy for you,
</item>
        <item>And that you must worship Me, (because) this is the
straight path?</item>
        <item>He had misguided lot many people from among you. So, did
you not have sense?</item>
        <item>Now) this is the Jahannam of which you were consistently
warned.</item>
        <item>Enter it today, because you have been persistently
denying (the truth).”</item>
        <item>Today We will set a seal on their mouths, and their
hands will speak to Us, and their legs will bear witness about what
they used to do.</item>
        <item>If We so will, We would wipe out their eyes (right here
in this world), and they would be racing towards the way, but how
would they see?</item>
        <item>And If We so will, We would disfigure them at their
places, and they would not be able to move, nor would they return.
</item>
        <item>And whomsoever We give long life, we reverse him in
creation. ¹⁰Then, do they have no sense?</item>
        <item>We did not teach him (the Holy Prophet) poetry, and it
is not proper for him. ¹¹It is nothing (of that sort,) but (it is) an
advice and a readable book that explains (the Truth),</item>
        <item>So that it may warn him who is alive (to listen to the
truth), and so that the word may prove true against the disbelievers.
</item>
        <item>Did they not see that We have created for them cattle,
among things made (directly) by Our hands, and then they become their
owners?</item>
        <item>And We have brought them under their control, so as some
of them are their means of transport, and some of them they eat.
</item>
        <item>And for them there are (other) benefits in them and
things to drink. ¹²So, would they not be grateful?</item>
        <item>They have adopted gods other than Allah, so that they
may be helped (by them).</item>
        <item>They cannot help them, rather they (the disbelievers
themselves) are (like) an army brought forth for (protecting) them
(the so-called co-gods) ¹³</item>
        <item>So, their remarks must not grieve you. Surely We know
what they conceal and what they disclose.</item>
        <item>Did man not see that We have created him from a drop of
semen? Then suddenly he stood as an open adversary (to Us).</item>
        <item>He has set up an argument about Us and forgot his
creation. He said, “Who will give life to the bones when they are
decayed?”</item>
        <item>Say, “These will be revived by the same One who had
created them for the first time, and who is fully aware of every
creation,</item>
        <item>The One who created for you fire from the green tree,
¹⁴and in no time you kindle from it.”</item>
        <item>Is it that the One who has created the heavens and the
earth has no power to create ones like them? Why not? He is the
Supreme Creator, the All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>His practice, when He intends to do something, is no
more than He says, “Be”, and it comes to be.</item>
        <item>So, pure (from every fault) is the One in whose hand is
the dominion of all things. And towards Him you are to be returned.
</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>(I swear) by those who stand in rows,</item>
        <item>Then by those who prevent firmly</item>
        <item>Then by those who recite the dhikr, ¹</item>
        <item>Surely your God is but One,</item>
        <item>The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is
between them, and Lord of the points of sunrise.</item>
        <item>Verily, We have decorated the nearest sky with an
adornment, the stars,</item>
        <item>And (have made them) a security against every rebellious
devil.</item>
        <item>They cannot listen to the Upper Realm and are hit from
every side</item>
        <item>To be driven off, and for them there is a lasting
punishment;</item>
        <item>However, if one snatches a little bit, he is pursued by
a bright flame. ²</item>
        <item>Now ask them, “Are they stronger in the formation of
their bodies, or those (other beings) that We have created?”
Certainly, We did create them from sticky clay.</item>
        <item>But you wonder (at their denial), and they mock (at the
idea of an Hereafter).</item>
        <item>And when any advice is given to them, they pay no heed
to it.</item>
        <item>And when they see a sign, they make fun of it,</item>
        <item>And say, “This is nothing but an open magic.</item>
        <item>Is it when we have died and become dust and bones, that
we shall be raised again,</item>
        <item>And even our fathers of aforetime?”</item>
        <item>Say, “Yes, and you shall be disgraced (too)!”</item>
        <item>So, it will be only a single castigating call, and all
of a sudden they will begin to see.</item>
        <item>And they will be saying, “Woe to us; this is the Day of
Retribution.”</item>
        <item>It will be said to them,) “This is the Day of Judgment
that you used to deny.”</item>
        <item>It will be said to the angels,) “Muster all those who
were unjust, and their fellows, and whatever they used to
worship</item>
        <item>Other than Allah, and show them the way to Jahannam ,
</item>
        <item>And stop them (for a while,) for they are to be asked
some questions.”</item>
        <item>Then they will be asked, “What is wrong with you that
you do not help each other?”</item>
        <item>On the contrary, that day all of them will have totally
surrendered.</item>
        <item>And some of them (the followers of their chiefs) will
turn to others (the chiefs), asking questions from one another.</item>
        <item>They (the followers) will say, “You were the ones who
used to come to (mislead) us forcefully.”</item>
        <item>They (the chiefs) will say, “On the contrary, you
yourselves were not believers.</item>
        <item>We had no authority over you at all, but you yourselves
were a transgressing people.</item>
        <item>So, the word of our Lord has come true against us.
Indeed, we have to taste (the punishment).</item>
        <item>We did misguide you, (because) we were ourselves
erroneous”.</item>
        <item>So, that day, they will share each other in punishment.
</item>
        <item>This is how We deal with the criminals.</item>
        <item>They were those to whom when it was said: “There is no
god but Allah”, they waxed proud,</item>
        <item>And used to say, “Are we really to leave our gods
because of an insane poet?”</item>
        <item>No, he has come with Truth and has confirmed all the
messengers (of Allah).</item>
        <item>Surely you have to taste the painful
punishment,__</item>
        <item>And you will be recompensed for nothing but for what you
used to do___</item>
        <item>Unlike Allah’s chosen servants.</item>
        <item>Those are the people for whom there is a known
provision,</item>
        <item>The fruits; and they will be honored</item>
        <item>In Gardens of Bliss</item>
        <item>Facing each other on couches.</item>
        <item>They will be served with a cup from a flowing drink,
</item>
        <item>That will be) white (and) delicious for those who drink.
</item>
        <item>There will be no headache therein, nor will they be
intoxicated with it,</item>
        <item>And by their side there will be females restricting
their gazes (to their husbands), having pretty big eyes,</item>
        <item>As if they were eggs hidden (under feathers, protected
from pollution).</item>
        <item>Then they will turn to each other asking questions
mutually.</item>
        <item>A speaker from them will say, “I had a companion (in the
worldly life)</item>
        <item>Who used to say (to me), “Are you one of those who
believe?</item>
        <item>Is it when we have died and become dust and bones? Is it
true that we are going to be recompensed (for our deeds)?”</item>
        <item>He (the speaker) will say (to other people in Paradise)
“Would you like to have a look (at Jahannam to find out what happened
to that companion of mine)?”</item>
        <item>So he will look and will see him in the middle of
Jahannam.</item>
        <item>He (the speaker) will say (to his companion seen in
Jahannam ), “By Allah, you were going almost to ruin me.</item>
        <item>But for the favor of my Lord, I would have been among
those produced for punishment.”</item>
        <item>Then the speaker will address other people of Paradise
in delight and wonder, saying,) “Are we not then to die anymore</item>
        <item>Beyond our first death, nor are we going to be
punished?”</item>
        <item>This is, indeed, the great achievement.</item>
        <item>For this kind (of achievement), all workers must work.
</item>
        <item>Is that (blissful Paradise) better for hospitality or
the tree of zaqqum ? ³</item>
        <item>We have made it a test for the unjust.</item>
        <item>It is a tree that comes forth in the bottom of Jahannam.
</item>
        <item>Its fruits are like the heads of devils.</item>
        <item>So, they have to eat from it and have to fill their
bellies with it.</item>
        <item>Then they will have, on top of it, a mixture made of
boiling water.</item>
        <item>Then, their final return is to the Fire.</item>
        <item>They found their fathers on the wrong path.</item>
        <item>So, they used to run in their footsteps.</item>
        <item>Most of the earlier ones (too) had gone astray before
them.</item>
        <item>We did send warners among them.</item>
        <item>So look, how was the end of those warned -</item>
        <item>Except Allah’s chosen servants.</item>
        <item>And Nuh did call Us (for help after he was disappointed
with his people), so (We accepted his prayer, as) We are the best to
respond.</item>
        <item>And We delivered him and his family from the great
agony,</item>
        <item>And made his progeny the sole survivors (from the
Deluge).</item>
        <item>And We left for him (a word of praise) among the later
people, (that is):</item>
        <item>Salam be on Nuh among (the people of) all the worlds.
⁴</item>
        <item>Certainly, this is how We reward those who are good in
their deeds.</item>
        <item>He was one of Our believing servants.</item>
        <item>Then, we drowned others.</item>
        <item>And certainly one of his adherents was Ibrahim.</item>
        <item>Remember) when he came to his Lord with a pure heart,
</item>
        <item>When he said to his father and his people, “What is that
which you worship?</item>
        <item>Do you wish (to have) fallacious gods other than Allah?
</item>
        <item>Then, what do you think about the Lord of the
worlds?”</item>
        <item>Then, he cast a look at the stars,</item>
        <item>And then said, “I feel indisposed" ⁵</item>
        <item>So they went away from him, turning their backs.</item>
        <item>And he made his way to their ‘gods’ and said to them,
“Why would you not eat?</item>
        <item>What is wrong with you that you do not speak?”</item>
        <item>Then he attacked them striking with his right hand.
</item>
        <item>Then, they (the idolaters) came to him rushing.</item>
        <item>He said, “Do you worship what is carved by yourselves,
</item>
        <item>While Allah has created you and what you make?”</item>
        <item>They said, “Build for him a structure, and throw him
into the blazing fire.”</item>
        <item>So, they intended to bring harm to him, but We made them
the lowest (by frustrating their plan). ⁶</item>
        <item>And he said, “I am going to my Lord. ⁷He will show me the
way.</item>
        <item>O my Lord, bless me with a righteous son.”</item>
        <item>So, We gave him the good news of a forbearing boy.
</item>
        <item>Thereafter, when he (the boy) reached an age in which he
could work with him, he (Ibrahim) said, “O my little son, I have seen
in a dream that I am slaughtering you, so consider, what is your
opinion?” He said, “O my dear father, do what you have been ordered to
do. You will find me, insha’allah , (if Allah wills) one of those who
endure patiently.”</item>
        <item>So, (it was a great episode) when both of them submitted
themselves (to Allah’s will), and he laid him on his forehead (to
slaughter him),</item>
        <item>And then We called out to him, “O Ibrahim,</item>
        <item>You did make the dream come true.” This is how We reward
those who are good in their deeds.</item>
        <item>This was indeed a trial that clearly demonstrated (their
obedience).</item>
        <item>And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice, ⁸</item>
        <item>And We left for him (a word of praise) among the later
people,</item>
        <item>That is,) “Salam be on Ibrahim!</item>
        <item>This is how We reward those who are good in their deeds.
</item>
        <item>Surely, he is among Our believing servants.</item>
        <item>And We gave him the good news of Ishaq (Isaac), a
prophet from among the righteous.</item>
        <item>And We did bless him, and Ishaq. And among the progeny
of both of them, some are good and some are utterly unjust to their
own selves.</item>
        <item>Certainly We bestowed favors upon Musa and Harun,</item>
        <item>And We delivered them and their people from the great
agony,</item>
        <item>And We helped them, so they became victors,</item>
        <item>And We gave them the clear book,</item>
        <item>And guided them to the straight path.</item>
        <item>And We left for them (a word of praise) among the later
people,</item>
        <item>That is,) Salam be on Musa and Harun!</item>
        <item>This is how We reward those who are good in their deeds.
</item>
        <item>Surely, both of them were among Our believing servants.
</item>
        <item>And surely, Ilyas is one of the messengers.</item>
        <item>Remember) when he said to his people: “Do you not fear
Allah?</item>
        <item>Do you invoke Ba‘l, ⁹and ignore the Best of the creators,
</item>
        <item>That is, Allah who is your Lord and the Lord of your
forefathers?”</item>
        <item>Then they rejected him. Therefore, they will be
arraigned -</item>
        <item>Except Allah’s chosen servants.</item>
        <item>And We left for him (a word of praise) among the later
people,</item>
        <item>That is,) “Salam on Ilyasin (Ilyas).</item>
        <item>This is how We reward those who are good in their deeds.
</item>
        <item>Surely, he was from among Our believing servants.</item>
        <item>And surely, Lut is one of the messengers.</item>
        <item>Remember) when We saved him and his family, all of them,
</item>
        <item>Except an old woman among those remaining behind.</item>
        <item>After that, We destroyed others</item>
        <item>And you do pass by them at daybreak</item>
        <item>And by nightfall. ¹⁰Would you still not understand?
</item>
        <item>And surely, Yunus (Jonah) is from among the messengers.
¹¹</item>
        <item>Remember) when he ran away towards the boat that was
already loaded.</item>
        <item>Then he participated in drawing lots (to offload one of
the passengers) and was the one who was defeated.</item>
        <item>Then the fish swallowed him while he was reproaching his
own self.</item>
        <item>Had he not been of those who proclaim Allah’s purity,
</item>
        <item>He would have definitely lived in its belly till the day
when the dead will be raised.</item>
        <item>Then We cast him ashore in the open while he was ill,
</item>
        <item>And We caused a tree of ourds to grow over him.</item>
        <item>And We had sent him (as messenger) to one hundred
thousand, or more.</item>
        <item>So, they believed, then, We let them enjoy for a time.
</item>
        <item>So ask them, “Does your Lord have daughters while they
have sons?” ¹²</item>
        <item>Or, had We created angels as females while they were
witnessing?</item>
        <item>Beware! They are the ones who, by way of a lie of
theirs, (have the audacity to) say,</item>
        <item>Allah has children” - and they are absolute liars.
</item>
        <item>Is it that Allah has chosen daughters (for Himself)
instead of sons?</item>
        <item>What is the matter with you? How (arbitrarily) do you
judge?</item>
        <item>Then, is it that you do not think about it?</item>
        <item>Or, is it that there is some open authority with you?
</item>
        <item>Then bring your book, if you are truthful.</item>
        <item>And they have made up between Him (Allah) and the Jinns
some kinship, ¹³while the Jinns already know that they are bound to be
seized.__</item>
        <item>Pure is Allah from what they describe__</item>
        <item>Except Allah’s chosen servants. ¹⁴</item>
        <item>So, you and those whom you worship,</item>
        <item>None of you can make anyone turn away from Him (Allah),
</item>
        <item>Except him who is to burn in Jahannam.</item>
        <item>And (the angels say,) “There is no one among us who does
not have a known station,</item>
        <item>And We, surely We, are those who stand in rows</item>
        <item>And We, surely We, are those who proclaim Allah’s
purity.”</item>
        <item>And they (the pagans) used to say,</item>
        <item>Had there been a scripture with us like that of the
former people,</item>
        <item>We would have certainly been Allah’s chosen servants.”
¹⁵</item>
        <item>Then (once the divine book came to them,) they
disbelieved in it. So, very soon they will come to know.</item>
        <item>And Our Word has already come to pass in favor of Our
servants, the messengers</item>
        <item>That) they are the ones who will be supported,</item>
        <item>And verily it is Our army (of chosen servants) that
prevails.</item>
        <item>So, withdraw your attention from them for some time.
</item>
        <item>But, watch them. They shall soon see (the reality).
</item>
        <item>Are they asking for Our punishment to come sooner?
</item>
        <item>So, when it will descend in their courtyard, then, evil
will be the morning of those warned.</item>
        <item>So, withdraw your attention from them for some time,
</item>
        <item>And watch. They shall soon see (the reality).</item>
        <item>Pure is your Lord, the Lord of all might and honor, from
what they describe</item>
        <item>And Salam be on the messengers</item>
        <item>And praised is Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>D . ¹I swear by the Qur’an, (the book) containing
advice, (this is true,)</item>
        <item>But those who disbelieve are (involved) in false pride
and opposition.</item>
        <item>How many a generation have We destroyed before them, so
they cried out (for mercy), while no time was left for having any
refuge.</item>
        <item>They (the pagans) wonder that a warner has come to them
from among themselves. And the disbelievers say, “This is a magician,
a sheer liar.</item>
        <item>Has he (not) turned all the gods into a single God? It
is a very strange thing indeed.”</item>
        <item>And the leaders among them walked out saying (to their
followers), “Walk away (from the Prophet,) and stay firm on (adhering
to) your gods. This (call of the Prophet) is surely something designed
(for his personal benefit).</item>
        <item>We never heard of it in the classical faith (of ours).
This is nothing but a false invention.</item>
        <item>Is it (believable) that the message of advice has been
sent down to him (alone) from among all of us?” The fact is that they
are in doubt about My message; rather, they have not yet tasted My
punishment.</item>
        <item>Do they have the treasures of the mercy of your Lord,
the Mighty, the Bountiful? ²</item>
        <item>Or do they have the ownership of the heavens and the
earth and what lies between them? Then let them ascend (to the sky) by
ropes.</item>
        <item>What is there (in Makkah) is just a host of the
(opposing) groups that has to be defeated.</item>
        <item>Even before them, the people of Nuh and ‘Ad and Fir‘aun
(Pharaoh), the man of stakes, ³</item>
        <item>And Thamud and the people of Lut and the people of
Aaikah have rejected (the messengers). They were the (strong) groups.
</item>
        <item>All of them did nothing but declare the messengers as
liars; hence, My punishment became due.</item>
        <item>And these people are waiting for nothing but for a
single Cry (the sound of the Trumpet to be blown on Doomsday) that
will have no pause.</item>
        <item>And they say, “O our Lord, give us our share (of the
punishment) sooner, before the Day of Reckoning.”</item>
        <item>Bear patiently with what they say, and remember Our
servant Dawud, the man of might. Surely he was ever-turning to Allah.
</item>
        <item>We had subjugated the mountains to join him (in) making
tasbih (i.e. pronouncing Allah’s purity) at evening and sunrise,
</item>
        <item>And the birds as well, mustered together. All were
turning to Allah with him. ⁴</item>
        <item>And We made his kingdom strong, and gave him wisdom and
decisive speech.</item>
        <item>Has there come to you the story of the litigants, ⁵when
they entered the sanctuary by climbing over the wall?</item>
        <item>When they entered upon Dawud, and he was scared of them,
they said, “Be not scared. We are two litigants; one of us has wronged
the other, so decide between us with truth, and do not cross the
limits, and guide us to the right path.</item>
        <item>This is my brother; he has ninety nine ewes, and I have
a single ewe; still he said, ‘Give it into my charge.’ And he
overpowered me in speech.”</item>
        <item>He (Dawud) said, “He has certainly wronged you by
demanding your ewe to be added to his ewe. Many partners oppress one
another, except those who believe and do righteous deeds, and very few
they are.” And Dawud realized that We had put him to a test, so he
prayed to his Lord for forgiveness, and bowing down, he fell in
prostration, and turned (to Allah). ⁶</item>
        <item>So we forgave him that (lapse), and surely he has a
place of nearness in Our presence, and an excellent resort.</item>
        <item>O Dawud, We have made you a vicegerent on earth, so
judge between people with truth, and do not follow the selfish desire,
lest it should lead you astray from Allah’s path. Surely those who go
astray from Allah’s path will have a severe punishment, because they
had forgotten the Day of Reckoning.</item>
        <item>We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is
between them in vain. That is the thinking of those who disbelieve.
So, woe to the disbelievers because of the Fire (they have to face).
</item>
        <item>Shall We make those who believe and do righteous deeds
equal to those who commit mischief on the earth? Or shall We make the
God-fearing equal to the sinners?</item>
        <item>This is a blessed Book We have revealed to you, so that
they deliberate in its verses, and so that the men of understanding
may heed to advice.</item>
        <item>And We blessed Dawud with Sulaiman. He was an excellent
servant (of Allah). Surely, he was great in turning (to Us, in
penitence and praise).</item>
        <item>Worth remembering is the incident) when the swift horses
of high breeding were presented before him in the evening.</item>
        <item>He said, “I held the love of the good things (i.e. these
horses) because of the remembrance of my Lord.” until it went behind
the veil.</item>
        <item>Then he said,) “Bring them back to me” - and he started
passing his hands over the shanks and the necks (of the horses).
⁷</item>
        <item>And indeed We tested Sulaiman while We threw on his
throne a body after which he turned (to Us). ⁸</item>
        <item>He said, “O my Lord, forgive me, and bless me with a
kingdom that will not be available to anyone after me. Surely, You are
the Bountiful.”</item>
        <item>Then We subjugated the wind for him that blew smoothly
on his command to wherever he wished, ⁹</item>
        <item>And (We subjugated to him) the devils (among Jinns), all
builders and divers,</item>
        <item>And many others held in chains. ¹⁰</item>
        <item>This is Our gift. So, do favor (to someone) or withhold
(it), with no (requirement to give) account. ¹¹</item>
        <item>He has a place of nearness in Our presence, and an
excellent end.</item>
        <item>And remember Our servant, Ayyub - when he called his
Lord saying, “The Shaitan (Satan) has inflicted weariness and pain
upon me.”</item>
        <item>Allah said to him,) “Strike (the ground) with your foot:
Here is a cool water to bathe, and a drink!” ¹²</item>
        <item>And We let him have his family and the like of them
besides, as a mercy from Us, and a reminder for the people of
understanding.</item>
        <item>And (We said to him,) “Take (a bundle of) thin twigs in
your hand, and strike with it, and do not violate your oath. ¹³Surely,
We found him very enduring. He was really an excellent servant.
Surely, he was great in turning (to Us, in penitence and praise).
</item>
        <item>And remember Our servants - Ibrahim and Ishaq and Ya‘qub
- the men of strength and the men of vision.</item>
        <item>We chose them for a trait of remembering the (eternal)
Home (in the Hereafter).</item>
        <item>And surely they are, in Our sight, among the chosen, the
best of the righteous.</item>
        <item>And remember Isma‘il and Al-Yasa‘ and Dhul-Kifl. Each
one of them was among the best of the righteous.</item>
        <item>This is a reminder (of what has passed). And surely the
God-fearing will have the best place to return:</item>
        <item>Everlasting gardens, with (their) doors opened for them.
</item>
        <item>They will be relaxing in it, calling there for plenteous
fruits and drinks;</item>
        <item>And in their company there will be females restricting
their glances (to their husbands, and) of matching ages.</item>
        <item>This is what you are being promised for the Day of
Reckoning.</item>
        <item>Surely, that is provision provided by Us, to which there
is no end.</item>
        <item>Having said this, the transgressors will surely have the
most evil place to return:</item>
        <item>The Jahannam , in which they will enter. So, how evil is
that place to rest?</item>
        <item>Let them taste this: hot water and pus,</item>
        <item>And other things similar to it of various kinds.</item>
        <item>When the leaders of the infidels will see their
followers entering the Hell after them, they will say to each other,)
“This is a multitude rushing into (the Hell) with you - they are not
welcome - they are to burn in the Fire.”</item>
        <item>They (the followers) will say (to their leaders) “No, it
is you who are not welcome; you are the ones who brought this upon
us.” So, how evil is the place to stay (for ever)!”</item>
        <item>They (the followers) will say, “Our Lord, whoever has
brought this on us, do increase his punishment twofold in the
Fire.”</item>
        <item>And they (the infidels) will say, “What is the matter
with us that we do not see those men (here in Hell) whom we used to
count amongst the worst? (i.e the Muslims whom the infidels used to
treat as the worst people among them)</item>
        <item>Had we taken them as a laughing-stock (unjustly), or
have our eyes missed them?”</item>
        <item>That is going to happen definitely, that is, the mutual
quarrel of the people of the Fire.</item>
        <item>Say, “I am only a warner, and there is no god but Allah,
the One, the All-Dominant,</item>
        <item>The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is
between them, the Mighty, the Very-Forgiving.”</item>
        <item>Say, “It is a great news</item>
        <item>To which you are averse.</item>
        <item>I had no knowledge of the Heavenly Beings when they were
debating (about the creation of ’Adam). ¹⁴</item>
        <item>Revelation is sent to me only because I am a plain
warner. ¹⁵</item>
        <item>When your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to create
man from clay.</item>
        <item>So, once I make him perfectly and breath My spirit into
him, you must fall down in prostration before him.”</item>
        <item>Then, the angels prostrated themselves, all of them
together -</item>
        <item>Except Iblis (Satan). He waxed proud, and became one of
the disbelievers.</item>
        <item>He (Allah) said, “O Iblis, what did prevent you from
prostrating yourself before what I created with My hands? Did you wax
proud or were you among the lofty ones?”</item>
        <item>He said, “I am better than him. You created me from
fire, and created him from clay.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Then, get out from here, for you are accursed,
</item>
        <item>And on you shall remain My curse till the Day of
Judgment.”</item>
        <item>He said, “O my Lord, then give me respite till the day
they are raised again.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Then, you have been given respite,</item>
        <item>Until the Day of the Appointed Time.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Then, I swear by Your Might, that I will
definitely lead them astray, all of them -</item>
        <item>Except Your chosen servants among them.”</item>
        <item>He (Allah) said, “Then, the truth is__and it is (always)
the truth that I speak__</item>
        <item>That I will definitely fill the Jahannam with you and
with those who will follow you from among them, all together.”</item>
        <item>Say (O Prophet to the unbelievers,) “I do not demand
from you any fee for it, nor am I from among those who make up things
artificially.</item>
        <item>It is nothing but an advice for all the worlds.</item>
        <item>And you will come to know its reality after a
while.”</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>This is the revelation of the Book from Allah, the
Mighty, the Wise.</item>
        <item>Surely We have revealed the Book to you with truth; so
worship Allah making your submission exclusive for Him.</item>
        <item>Remember, Allah alone deserves the exclusive submission.
As for those who have adopted guardians other than Him (saying), “We
worship them for no other reason but because they would bring us near
to Allah closely”, Allah will judge between them in the matters in
which they are differing. Surely, Allah does not guide anyone who is
liar, highly infidel.</item>
        <item>Had Allah opted to have a son of His own, He would have
definitely chosen anyone, as He wished, out of what He had created.
(But), Pure is He. He is Allah, the Only One, the All-Dominant.</item>
        <item>He created the heavens and the earth for just purpose.
He wraps the night over the day and He wraps the day over the night,
and He has put the sun and the moon under His command, each one of
them moving for an appointed term. Remember, He is the Mighty, the
Most-Forgiving.</item>
        <item>He created you from a single person, then (once this
person was created,) He made his match from him, and sent down for you
eight pairs of the cattle. ¹He creates you in the wombs of your
mothers, creation after creation, in three layers of darkness. That is
your Allah, your Lord. To Him belongs the whole Kingdom. There is no
god but He. Then, to where are you being diverted (by your whims)?
</item>
        <item>If you disbelieve, then, Allah does not need you at all,
however He does not like for His servants to be disbelievers; and if
you are grateful, He will like it for you. No one will bear the burden
of someone else. Then, to your Lord is your return; so He will tell
you about what you used to do. He is aware of whatever lies in the
hearts.</item>
        <item>And when man is afflicted by pain, he calls his Lord
turning to Him passionately. Thereafter, when He blesses him with some
favor from Him, he forgets that for which he was calling Him earlier,
and sets up partners for Allah, so that he leads others astray from
His way. Say, “Enjoy (the pleasure of) your disbelief for a while,
(then) surely, you are from among the people of the Fire.”</item>
        <item>Can (such people be equal to) the one who worships
during the hours of night, prostrating himself and standing, fearing
the Hereafter and having hopes in his Lord’s mercy? Say, “Can those
who know and those who do not know become equal?” It is only the
people of understanding who are receptive of the advice.</item>
        <item>Say (on My behalf) “O My servants who believe, fear your
Lord. Those who do good deeds in this world will have a good return,
and the earth of Allah is wide. ²Certainly those who observe patience
will be given their reward in full without measure.</item>
        <item>Say, “I have been ordered to worship Allah, making my
submission exclusive to Him.</item>
        <item>And I have been ordered to be the first of those who
submit.”</item>
        <item>Say, “If I were to disobey my Lord, I fear the
punishment of a great day.”</item>
        <item>Say, “It is Allah whom I worship, making my submission
exclusive to Him.</item>
        <item>So, worship what you wish other than Him.” Say, “Indeed,
the losers are those who (will) lose their selves and their people on
the Day of Judgment. Beware, that is really the obvious loss.”</item>
        <item>For them there are canopies of fire on top of them and
canopies (of fire) underneath them. That is the thing against which
Allah warns His servants. “So, O servants of Mine, fear Me.”</item>
        <item>And those who abstain from worshipping the Taghut ³and
turn fervently to Allah, for them there is good news. So, give the
good news to My servants</item>
        <item>Who listen to what is said, then, follow the best of it.
Those are the ones whom Allah has guided, and those are the ones who
possess understanding.</item>
        <item>So tell Me about the one for whom the word of punishment
is destined, - is it you, then, who would save someone who is already
in the Fire?</item>
        <item>But, for those who fear their Lord, there are chambers
with chambers built on top of them, with rivers running from
underneath them. This is Allah’s promise. Allah does not go back on
any promise.</item>
        <item>Have you not seen that Allah sent down water from the
sky, then made it penetrate into the earth (and gush forth) in the
form of springs? Then He brings forth with it crops of different
colors, and afterwards they wither, and you see them turned yellow,
then He makes them chaff. Surely in that there is a lesson for the
people of understanding.</item>
        <item>So I ask about a person whose heart Allah has opened up
for Islam, and consequently he proceeds in a light from his Lord. (Can
he be equal to the one whose heart is hardened?) So, woe to those
whose hearts are too hard to remember Allah. Those are wandering in
open error.</item>
        <item>Allah has sent down the best discourse, a book
containing subjects resembling each other, mentioned again and again,
shivered from which are the skins of those who have awe of their Lord.
Then, their skins and their hearts become soft enough to tend to the
remembrance of Allah. This is the Guidance of Allah with which He
brings to the right path whomsoever He wills. As for the one whom
Allah lets go astray, for him there is no one to guide.</item>
        <item>Tell Me about the one who tries to save himself from the
worst punishment with his face ⁴on the Day of Judgment, (whether he is
equal to the one who is not liable to any punishment.) And it will be
said to the wrongdoers, “Have a taste of what you used to
earn.”</item>
        <item>Those before them had also rejected (the messengers) and
consequently, the punishment came upon them in a way that they had
never imagined.</item>
        <item>Then Allah made them taste disgrace in the worldly life,
and of course the punishment of the Hereafter is much greater. Only if
they knew!</item>
        <item>And We have cited for people all sorts of examples in
this Qur’an, so that they may receive the message</item>
        <item>Through an Arabic Qur’an that has no digression (from
the truth), so that they may be God-fearing.</item>
        <item>Allah has given an example: There is a man (enslaved
and) owned by some partners having rivalry with each other, and (on
the other hand,) there is a man solely owned by a single man. Can they
be equal in comparison? ⁵Praise be to Allah! (The truth stands
established). But, most of them do not know.</item>
        <item>Verily, you are to die and they are to die.</item>
        <item>After that, on the Day of Doom, you will surely place
your disputes before your Lord.</item>
        <item>So, who is more unjust than him who forges a lie against
Allah and rejects the truth when it reached him? Is it not that in
Jahannam (Hell) there is an abode for the disbelievers?</item>
        <item>As for the one who has come with the truth and believed
it to be true, then such people are the ones who are God-fearing.
</item>
        <item>For them, with their Lord, there is what they wish. That
is the reward of those who are good in their deeds,</item>
        <item>So that Allah wipes out from them the worst deeds they
did, and gives their reward to them for the best of what they used to
do.</item>
        <item>Is Allah not sufficient for (the protection of) His
slave? They are frightening you of those (false gods whom they
worship) other than Him. Whomsoever Allah would let go astray, for him
there is no one to guide.</item>
        <item>And whomsoever Allah gives guidance, for him there is no
one to misguide. Is it not that Allah is Mighty, Powerful to avenge?
</item>
        <item>If you ask them as to who created the heavens and the
earth, they will certainly say, “Allah.” Say, “Then, tell me about
those whom you invoke other than Allah, if Allah intends to cause some
harm to me, are they (able) to remove the harm caused by Him? Or if He
intends to bless me with mercy, are they (able) to hold back His mercy
(from me)?” Say, “Allah is sufficient for me. In Him trust those who
(rightly) trust (in someone).”</item>
        <item>Say, “O my people, do at your place (what you are
doing). I am to do (what I have been ordered to). Very soon, you will
come to know</item>
        <item>As to who will be visited by a punishment that will
disgrace him, and upon whom a lasting punishment will rest.</item>
        <item>We have sent down to you the Book for the people with
truth. So, whoever follows the guidance, it is for his own good, and
whoever goes astray, he will go astray only to his own detriment - and
you are not responsible for them.</item>
        <item>Allah fully takes away the souls (of the people) at the
time of their death, and (of) those who do not die, in their sleep.
Then He withholds those on whom He had decreed death, and sends others
back, up to an appointed term. Surely, in this, there are signs for a
people who ponder.</item>
        <item>Is it that they have adopted intercessors out of those
(whom they invoke) other than Allah? Say, “(Do you take them as
intercessors) even though they have no power at all, nor do they
understand?”</item>
        <item>Say, “Intercession belongs entirely to Allah.”</item>
        <item>When Allah is mentioned alone, the hearts of those who
do not believe in the Hereafter are filled with disgust, and when
those (whom they worship) other than Him are mentioned, they become
happy forthwith.</item>
        <item>Say, “O Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth,
the Knower of the unseen and the seen, you will judge between Your
servants in that about which they used to differ.</item>
        <item>Were the wrongdoers to own all that is on earth, and
even twice as much, they would surely seek to ransom themselves with
it against the evil punishment on the Day of Judgment. There will
appear to them from Allah what they have never imagined.</item>
        <item>Unveiled to them will be the evils of what they used to
earn; and encircled they will be by what they used to ridicule.</item>
        <item>When man is visited by a trouble, he prays to Us, but
when, after that, We favor him with some blessing from Us, he says,
“This is given to me because of (my) knowledge.” No, but this is a
trial, yet most of them do not know.</item>
        <item>The same was said by those before them, but what they
used to earn was of no avail to them,</item>
        <item>And they were overtaken by the evils of what they had
earned; and the wrongdoers from these (infidels too) will be overtaken
by the evils of what they have earned - and they will not be able to
escape.</item>
        <item>Do they not know that it is Allah who extends provision
to whomsoever He wills, and straitens (it for whomsoever He wills).
Surely in that, there are signs for a people who believe.</item>
        <item>Say (on My behalf), “O servants of Mine who have acted
recklessly against their own selves, do not despair of Allah’s mercy.
Surely, Allah will forgive all sins. Surely, He is the One who is the
Most-Forgiving, the Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Turn passionately towards your Lord, and submit to Him
before the punishment comes to you, after which you will not be
helped.</item>
        <item>And follow the best of what has been sent down to you
from your Lord before the punishment comes to you suddenly when you do
not even expect,</item>
        <item>Lest someone should say, “Pity on me, because I fell
short in respect of (observing the rights of) Allah and in fact, I was
one of those who mocked”,</item>
        <item>Or, (lest) someone should say, “If Allah were to show me
the way, I would have surely been among those who fear Allah”,</item>
        <item>Or, (lest) someone should say when he sees the
punishment, “Would that I have a chance to return, so that I may
become one of those who are good in their deeds.”</item>
        <item>No! My verses had reached you, but you called them
untrue, and waxed proud, and became of those who disbelieved.</item>
        <item>And on the Day of Judgment, you will see those who had
forged lies against Allah (in a state) that their faces are turned
black. Is it not that in Jahannam there is an abode for the arrogant?
</item>
        <item>And Allah will save the God-fearing (from Jahannam ),
with utmost success granted to them, so as no evil will touch them,
nor will they grieve.</item>
        <item>Allah is Creator of everything, and He is the Guardian
over everything.</item>
        <item>To Him belong the keys to the heavens and the earth. As
for those who have rejected the verses of Allah, it is they who are
the losers.</item>
        <item>Say, “Is it, then, someone other than Allah that you ask
me to worship, O ignorant people?”</item>
        <item>It has already been revealed to you and to those before
you (that): If you associate (partners with Allah), your deeds shall
be rendered useless, and you shall be among the losers.</item>
        <item>On the contrary, it is Allah whom you should worship;
and be among the grateful.</item>
        <item>They did not hold Allah in His true esteem. The whole
earth will be in a single grip of His hand on the Day of Doom, and the
heavens (will be) rolled up on his right hand. Pure is He, far too
higher than what they associate with Him.</item>
        <item>And Horn (sur ) will be blown, and all those in the
heavens and all those in the earth will faint, except the one whom
Allah wills (otherwise). ⁶Thereafter, it will be blown once again, and
suddenly they will stand up, looking around.</item>
        <item>And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord, and
the book (of everyone’s deeds) will be placed, and the prophets and
the witnesses will be brought, and matters will be decided between
them with justice, and they will not be wronged.</item>
        <item>And everyone will be paid in full for what he did - and
He knows best what they do.</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieved will be driven towards Jahannam in
groups, until when they reach it, its gates will be opened, and its
keepers will say to them, “Did messengers from among you not come to
you reciting to you the verses of your Lord, and warning you about the
meeting of this day of yours?” They will say, “Yes (they did),but the
word of punishment had become certain against those who
disbelieved.”</item>
        <item>It will be said, “Enter the gates of Jahannam to live in
it forever.” So, how evil is the dwelling-place of the arrogant!
</item>
        <item>And those who used to fear their Lord will be led
towards Jannah (Paradise) in groups, until when they reach it, while
its gates will be (already) opened (for them), and its keepers will
say to them, “Salamun-’alaikum (peace be on you). How good are you!
So, enter it to live here forever.”</item>
        <item>And they will say, “Alhamdulillah : Praise belongs to
Allah who made His promise come true for us, and made us inherit the
territory, so as we can dwell anywhere we wish in Jannah (Paradise) .
So, excellent is the reward of those who did (good) deeds.</item>
        <item>And you will see the angels ringed around the Throne
proclaiming the purity of their Lord, along with His praise, and
matters will stand settled between them rightfully, and it will be
said: “Alhamdulillahi-rabbil‘alamin : Praise belongs to Allah, the
Lord of the worlds.”</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Ha Mim . ¹</item>
        <item>This is revelation of the Book from Allah, the Mighty,
the All-Knowing,</item>
        <item>The One who forgives sins and accepts repentance, the
One who is severe in punishment, the One who is the source of all
power. There is no god but He. To Him is the ultimate return (of all).
</item>
        <item>No one quarrels about the verses of Allah, except those
who disbelieve. So, their (prosperous) movements in the cities should
not deceive you. ²</item>
        <item>Before these, the people of Nuh and the groups after
them had rejected (the messengers). Every group intended to seize
their messenger, and raised disputes on the basis of falsehood, so
that they might refute the truth with it, hence I seized them. So, how
was My punishment?</item>
        <item>And similarly, the word of your Lord has become due
against those who disbelieve__that they are the people of the Fire.
</item>
        <item>Those who are bearing the Throne and those who are
around it ³pronounce the purity of your Lord along with His praise,
and believe in Him, and pray for the forgiveness of those who believe,
(saying): “Our Lord, Your mercy and knowledge comprehends everything;
so forgive those who repent and follow Your way, and save them from
the punishment of the Fire.</item>
        <item>And, our Lord, admit them to the eternal gardens of
Jannah (Paradise) that You have promised for them, and (admit) those
as well who did good from among their fathers and wives and children.
You, only You, are the Mighty, the Wise,</item>
        <item>And save them from evils (of punishment). And whomsoever
you save from evils that day, it is surely because you bless him with
mercy. And that is the great achievement indeed.”</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieve will be addressed (by a voice
saying): “Allah’s hatred (for you), when you were invited to the true
faith and you refused, was greater than your hatred for yourselves
(today when you are hating your own selves out of remorse).</item>
        <item>They will say, “Our Lord, You gave us death twice and
You gave us life twice. ⁴Now we confess our sins. So, is there any way
to come out of here?”</item>
        <item>The reply will be, “No.) This is because whenever Allah
alone was invoked, you used to disbelieve, and if partners were
associated with Him, you used to believe. Now the decision lies with
Allah, the High, the Great.”</item>
        <item>It is He who shows you His signs and sends down
provision for you from the sky; and no one takes lesson but the one
who turns to Him.</item>
        <item>So, worship Allah, making your submission exclusive for
Him, even though the disbelievers dislike (it).</item>
        <item>He is High in stations, the Lord of the Throne. He sends
the spirit down, under His command, on whomever He wills from among
His servants, ⁵so that he warns of the Day of Encounter -</item>
        <item>The day they will come in open view. Nothing about them
will remain hidden from Allah. To whom belongs the kingdom today? To
Allah alone, the One, the All-Dominant.</item>
        <item>Today, everyone will be recompensed for what one earned.
There is no injustice today. Surely, Allah is swift in reckoning.
</item>
        <item>And warn them of the Day of approaching horror, when
hearts will jump up into the throats, (and they will be) choked. There
will be neither a friend for the unjust, nor an intercessor to be
listened to.</item>
        <item>He knows the treachery of the eyes and whatever is
concealed by hearts.</item>
        <item>He will give His judgment with truth. And those whom
they invoke beside Him cannot judge anything. Surely, it is Allah who
is Hearing, Seeing.</item>
        <item>Have they not traveled through the earth and seen how
was the fate of those who used to be before them? They were stronger
than these in power and in traces left on the earth, but Allah seized
them because of their sins. There was no one to save them from Allah.
</item>
        <item>That was because messengers used to come to them with
clear signs, but they disbelieved. Then, Allah seized them. Surely, He
is Strong, severe in punishment.</item>
        <item>Indeed We sent Musa with Our signs and a manifest
proof</item>
        <item>To Pharaoh and Haman and Qarun, ⁶but they said, “He is a
sorcerer, a liar.”</item>
        <item>And when he brought them the truth from Us, they said,
“Kill the sons of those who have accepted faith with him, and spare
the lives of their women.” But the plot of the disbelievers is nothing
but a failure.</item>
        <item>And Pharaoh said, “Let me kill Musa, and let him call
his Lord. I am afraid that he will change your religion or he will
cause havoc to appear in the land.”</item>
        <item>And Musa said, “I have sought protection of my Lord and
your Lord from every arrogant man who does not believe in the Day of
Reckoning.”</item>
        <item>And said a believing man from the House of Pharaoh who
had kept his faith secret, “Would you kill a man because he says -
‘Allah is my Lord’ - while he has come to you with clear signs from
your Lord? If he is a liar, his lie will fall back on himself, and if
he is truthful, some of that (punishment) of which he warns you will
afflict you. Indeed, Allah does not give guidance to anyone who is
transgressor, a liar.</item>
        <item>O my people, the kingdom is yours today, while you are
dominant on the land. But, who is going to help us against Allah’s
punishment, if it comes upon us?” Pharaoh said, “I do not give you an
opinion unless I myself believe it to be correct, and I do not direct
you to anything but to the right way.”</item>
        <item>Said he who had believed, “I fear for you something like
a day of the (disbelieving) groups (of the past),</item>
        <item>Like the fate of the people of Nuh and ‘Ad and Thamud
and those who were after them - and Allah does not intend to do any
injustice to His servants.</item>
        <item>And O my people, I fear for you a day in which people
will call one another,</item>
        <item>A day when you will turn back on your heels, having no
one to save you from Allah - but, whomever Allah lets go astray, for
him there is no one to guide.</item>
        <item>And Yusuf had already come to you earlier with clear
signs, but you remained in suspicion about what he brought to you -
until when he died, you said, ‘Allah will never send a messenger after
him.’ That is how Allah lets go astray anyone who crosses limits and
lives in doubt, -</item>
        <item>Those who quarrel in Allah’s verses without any
authority having reached them. It is terribly hateful with Allah and
with those who believe. That is how Allah stamps a seal on the entire
heart of an arrogant tyrant.”</item>
        <item>And Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) said, “O Haman, make a tower for
me, perhaps I could reach the ways -</item>
        <item>The ways to the heavens, and peek towards the God of
Musa. And indeed I deem him a liar.” That is how his evil deeds were
made attractive to Fir‘aun, and (how) he was held back from the way.
The evil design of Fir‘aun was (to end) in nothing but ruin.</item>
        <item>And said he who had believed, “O my people, follow me, I
will show you the path of guidance.</item>
        <item>O my people, this life of the world is only a
(momentary) benefit, while the Hereafter is, indeed, the place of
permanent living.</item>
        <item>The one who does something evil will not be punished but
in its equal proportion, but the one who does a righteous deed, be he
male or female, while he is a believer, then, such people will enter
the Jannah (Paradise) where they will be provided with bounties beyond
reckoning.</item>
        <item>And O my people, what is wrong with me that I call you
to salvation and you call me to the Fire?</item>
        <item>You invite me to reject my belief in Allah and ascribe
to Him partners about whom I have no knowledge, while I invite you to
(Him who is) the Mighty, the Most-Forgiving.</item>
        <item>It is obvious that those (gods) to whom you are inviting
me are not worth calling, neither in this world nor in the world to
come, and that we have to return back to Allah, and that the
transgressors are indeed the people of the Fire.</item>
        <item>Soon you will remember what I am saying to you. And I
entrust my matter with Allah. Surely, Allah has all (His) servants in
sight.”</item>
        <item>Then Allah saved him from the evils of what they
designed, and the House of Pharaoh was encircled by an evil
punishment.</item>
        <item>It is the Fire before which they are presented morning
and evening. ⁷And on the day when the Hour (of final judgment) will
take place, (the order will be released,): “Admit the family of
Pharaoh into the most severe punishment.”</item>
        <item>And (worth remembering is the time) when they (the
infidels) will argue with each other in the Fire. So, the weak will
say to those who were arrogant, “Surely, we used to be your followers,
would you, then, stand for us in (suffering at least a) part of the
(punishment of) Fire?”</item>
        <item>Those who were arrogant will say, “We all are in it.
Allah has already passed the judgment between (His) servants.</item>
        <item>And those in the Fire will say to the keepers of
Jahannam (Hell), “Pray to your Lord to lighten the punishment for us
some day.”</item>
        <item>They will say, “Had your messengers not been coming to
you with open signs?” They will say, “Of course, (they had come).”
They (the keepers) will say, “Then, keep praying” - but praying of
disbelievers (in the Hereafter) is only in vain.</item>
        <item>Surely, We do help Our messengers and the believers, in
the worldly life, as well as (we will help them) on the day in which
witnesses will stand (to give their testimony)-</item>
        <item>A day when apology of the unjust will bring them no
benefit, and on them shall be the curse, and for them will be the evil
abode.</item>
        <item>We gave Guidance to Musa, while We made the children of
Isra’il inherit the Book -</item>
        <item>As a guide and advice for people of understanding.
</item>
        <item>So, be patient - surely the promise of Allah is true -
and seek forgiveness for your sins, and proclaim the purity and praise
of your Lord in the afternoon and at dawn.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who quarrel in Allah’s verses without any
authority having reached them, there is nothing in their hearts but
pride of greatness that they are not (able) to reach. So, seek refuge
with Allah. Surely, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</item>
        <item>Certainly, the creation of the heavens and the earth is
greater than the creation of human beings, but most human beings do
not know.</item>
        <item>The blind one and the sighted one are not equal, and
those who believed and did good deeds and the evil ones are not
(equal) either. Little you heed to the advice!</item>
        <item>Certainly, the Hour is bound to come. There is no doubt
in it, but most of the people do not believe.</item>
        <item>Your Lord has said, “Call Me, I will respond to you.
Definitely those who show arrogance against worshipping Me shall enter
Jahannam (Hell) with disgrace.</item>
        <item>Allah is the One who made for you the night, so that you
may have rest in it, and the day to let you see. Surely, Allah is most
kind to people, but most of the people do not offer gratitude.</item>
        <item>This is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of everything.
There is no god but He. Then, from where are you being reversed (by
your selfish desires)?</item>
        <item>Similarly reversed were those who used to deny Our
verses.</item>
        <item>Allah is the One who made for you the earth a place to
live, and the sky a roof, and shaped you, and made your shapes so good
- and provided you with a lot of good things. That is Allah, your
Lord. So, Glorious is Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</item>
        <item>He is Ever-living. There is no god but He. So worship
Him making your submission exclusive for Him. All praise belongs to
Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.</item>
        <item>Say, “I have been ordered not to worship those whom you
invoke beside Allah when clear signs from my Lord have (already) come
to me, and I have been ordered that I should submit to the Lord of the
worlds.”</item>
        <item>He is the One who created you from dust, then from a
drop of semen, then from a clot. After that, He takes you out as an
infant. Then, (He makes you grow) so that you reach your full
maturity, and, thereafter, become old - and some of you die earlier -
and so that you reach the appointed term, and so that you understand.
</item>
        <item>He is the One who gives life and brings death, and when
He decides to do something, He only says to it: “Be” and it comes to
be.</item>
        <item>Have you not seen those who quarrel in Allah’s verses?
From where are they being turned away (by their selfish desires?)
</item>
        <item>Those who rejected the Book and what We sent with Our
messengers. So, they will soon come to know,</item>
        <item>When shackles will be round their necks, and chains.
They will be dragged</item>
        <item>Into the hot water after which they will be thrown into
the Fire as a fuel.</item>
        <item>Then, it will be said to them, “Where are those whom you
used to associate (in worship)</item>
        <item>Beside Allah?” They will say, “They are lost to us,
rather, we used to invoke nothing at all.” ⁸This is how Allah makes
disbelievers get lost.</item>
        <item>It will be said to them,) “This is because you used to
rejoice on the earth wrongfully, and because you used to show
arrogance.</item>
        <item>Enter the gates of Jahannam to live in it forever. So,
how evil is the abode of the arrogant.</item>
        <item>Therefore, be patient. Surely, Allah’s promise is true.
Then, (O Prophet,) whether We show you (in your life) a part of the
promise We are making to them, or make you die (before they are
punished), in any case they have to be returned to Us.</item>
        <item>We had sent messengers before you. Among them there are
those whose history We have narrated to you, and of them there are
those whose history We did not narrate to you. And it is not up to a
messenger that he could come up with a sign without permission from
Allah. ⁹So, when the command of Allah will come, matters will stand
decided justly, and on that occasion all adherents of falsehood will
turn into losers.</item>
        <item>Allah is the One who made for you the cattle, so that
you may ride some of them,__ and of them you eat;</item>
        <item>And for you there are (other) benefits in them__ and so
that, (by riding) on them, you meet any need you have in your hearts;
and on them and on boats you are carried.</item>
        <item>He shows you His signs. Then, which of the signs of
Allah would you (still) deny?</item>
        <item>Have they not traveled through the earth and seen how
was the fate of those before them? Most of them were more in numbers
than these, and superior in vigor and vestiges left on the earth. So
then, whatever they used to earn did not work for them at all.</item>
        <item>When their messengers came to them with manifest signs,
they exulted because of whatever knowledge they had, and they were
encircled by what they used to ridicule.</item>
        <item>When they saw Our punishment, they said, “We have (now)
come to believe in Allah alone, and We have rejected everything we
used to ascribe (to Him) as partners.”</item>
        <item>But, their profession of faith was not (competent) to
benefit them, once they had seen Our punishment - a customary practice
of Allah that has been there all along in the matter of His servants -
and hence, the disbelievers became the losers.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Ha Mim ¹</item>
        <item>This is a revelation from the All-Merciful, the VeryMerciful-</item>
        <item>A book whose verses are elaborated in the form of an
Arabic Qur’an for a people who understand,</item>
        <item>As a bearer of good news and warning. Yet most of them
turned away, so they do not listen.</item>
        <item>And they say, “Our hearts are (wrapped) in covers
against that (faith) to which you invite us, and there is deafness in
our ears, and there is a barrier between you and us. So, do (in your
way). We too are doing (in our own way)”.</item>
        <item>Say, “I am but a human being like you; it is revealed to
me that your god is only One God. So, turn straight towards Him, and
seek forgiveness from Him, and woe to the Mushriks (those who ascribe
partners to Allah)</item>
        <item>Who do not pay Zakah ; and of the life of the Hereafter,
they are deniers.”</item>
        <item>As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, for
them there is a reward that will never be interrupted.</item>
        <item>Say, “Do you really disbelieve in the One who has
created the earth in two days, and ascribe to Him partners? That is
the Lord of the worlds.</item>
        <item>He has placed firm mountains in it (the earth) towering
above it, and put blessings in it, and proportioned its foods therein,
in four days, equal for those who ask.²</item>
        <item>Then He turned straight to the sky, while it was a
smoke, and said to it and to the earth, “Come (to My obedience), both
of you, willingly or unwillingly.” Both said, “We come
willingly.”</item>
        <item>So He accomplished them as seven skies in two days, and
settled in every sky its (due) thing. And We have decorated the
closest sky with lamps, and protected it properly. ³All this is the
determination of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>So, if they turn away, then say, “I have warned you of a
calamity like the calamity of ‘Ad and Thamud,</item>
        <item>When the messengers came to them from their front and
from their rear, saying, “Do not worship anyone but Allah.” They said,
“Had our Lord (really) willed (to send someone as messenger), He would
have sent down angels. So, we are deniers of what you have been sent
with.”</item>
        <item>As for ‘Ad, they showed arrogance in the land with no
right (to do so), and said, “Who is stronger than us in power?” Did
they not see that Allah, who created them, is stronger than them in
power? And they used to reject Our signs.</item>
        <item>So, We let loose a wild wind on them in unlucky days to
make them taste the humiliating punishment in the present life. And of
course, the punishment of the Hereafter will be much more humiliating,
and they will not be helped.</item>
        <item>As for Thamud, We showed them the way, but they
preferred blindness to the guidance. Therefore, they were seized by
the bang of the abasing punishment because of what they used to earn.
</item>
        <item>And We saved those who believed and used to be Godfearing.</item>
        <item>Remind them of) the day when Allah’s enemies will be
mustered towards the Fire. So they will be kept under control,</item>
        <item>Until when they will come to it, their ears and their
eyes and their skins will testify against them about what they used to
do.</item>
        <item>And they will say to their skins, “Why did you testify
against us?” They (the skins) will say, “We were made to speak by
Allah, the One who has made every thing to speak.” And He had created
you the first time, and to Him you are going to be returned.</item>
        <item>And you had not been hiding your selves (when committing
sins) from your ears and your eyes and your skins that would bear
witness against you, but you thought that Allah did not know much of
what you did. ⁴</item>
        <item>This thought of yours that you conceived about your Lord
brought you to ruin, and you became among the losers.</item>
        <item>Now, if they endure patiently, even then the Fire is
their abode, and if they seek forgiveness, they are not among those
(who could be) forgiven.</item>
        <item>And We had assigned for them fellows (in the worldly
life) who beautified for them what was before them and what was behind
them. ⁵And (thus) the word (of punishment) became due against them
along with the communities that passed before them from Jinns and
human beings. Surely they were the losers.</item>
        <item>And said those who disbelieved, “Do not listen to this
Qur’an, and make noise during its recitation, so that you may
overcome.”</item>
        <item>So, We will certainly make them taste a severe
punishment, and will certainly recompense them for the worst of what
they used to do.</item>
        <item>That is the recompense of the enemies of Allah_ the
Fire. For them there is the eternal home, as a recompense for their
persistent denial of Our verses.</item>
        <item>And those who disbelieve will say, “Our Lord, show us
the two, out of the Jinns and the humans, who led us astray and we
will put both of them under our feet, so that they become among the
lowest.” ⁶</item>
        <item>Surely, those who have declared: “Our Lord is Allah”,
then remained steadfast, on them the angels will descend, saying, “Do
not fear, and do not grieve; and be happy with the good news of the
Jannah (Paradise) that you had been promised.</item>
        <item>We have been your friends in the worldly life, and (will
remain as such) in the Hereafter. And for you here is whatever your
souls desire, and for you here is whatever you call for</item>
        <item>A gift of welcome from the Most-forgiving, the VeryMerciful”.</item>
        <item>Who can be better in words than the one who calls
towards Allah, and acts righteously and says, “I am one of those who
submit themselves (to Allah)”?</item>
        <item>Good and evil are not equal. Repel (evil) with what is
best, and you will see that the one you had mutual enmity with him
will turn as if he were a close friend.</item>
        <item>And no one is blessed with this (attitude) but those who
observe patience, and no one is blessed with this (attitude) but a man
of great luck.</item>
        <item>And should a stroke from Shaitan (Satan) strike you,
seek refuge with Allah. Surely, He is the All-Hearing, the AllKnowing.</item>
        <item>Among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun
and the moon. Do not prostrate yourselves to the sun, or to the moon.
And prostrate yourselves to Allah who has created them, if it is Him
whom you worship.</item>
        <item>Still, if they show arrogance, then those who are with
your Lord proclaim His purity night and day, and they do not get
weary. ⁷</item>
        <item>And among His signs is that you see the land inactive;
then, once We send down water thereto, it gets excited and swells.
Surely, the One who has given life to it is the One who gives life to
the dead. No doubt, He is powerful to do everything.</item>
        <item>Surely those who adopt perversity about Our verses are
not hidden from Us. So, tell me which one is better: the one who is
thrown into the Fire, or the one who will come safely on the Day of
Judgment? Do whatever you wish. He is watchful of whatever you do.
</item>
        <item>Surely those who have rejected the advice (the Qur’an)
when it came to them (are the ones who adopted perversity, and are not
hidden from Us). And surely, it is an unassailable book</item>
        <item>That cannot be approached by falsehood, neither from its
front, nor from its behind __a revelation from the All-Wise, the EverPraised.</item>
        <item>Nothing is being said to you but what has been said to
the messengers before you. Your Lord is certainly the Lord of
forgiveness and the Lord of painful punishment.</item>
        <item>Had We made it a non-Arabic Qur’an, they would have
said, “Why are its verses not clearly explained? Is it a non-Arabic
(book) and an Arab (messenger)?” ⁸Say, “For those who believe, it is
guidance and cure. As for those who do not believe, there is deafness
in their ears, and for them it is blindness. Such people are being
called from a distant place.”</item>
        <item>And We gave Musa the book, then it was disputed (as
well). But for a word that had already come from your Lord, the matter
would have been decided between them. They are in confounding doubt
about it.</item>
        <item>If someone acts righteously, he does so for the benefit
of his own soul, and if someone commits evil, he does so against it.
Your Lord is not unjust to His servants.</item>
        <item>To Him alone the knowledge of the Hour (the exact time
of Doomsday) is to be referred. ⁹No fruits come out of their sheaths,
nor does a female conceive a baby, nor does she deliver it, but with
His knowledge. And (remember) the Day when He will call them: “Where
are My partners?” They will say, “We declare to you that no one of us
is to testify (that you have partners).”</item>
        <item>And whatever they used to invoke earlier will vanish
from them, and they will realize that they have no way to escape.
</item>
        <item>Man ¹⁰does not get weary of craving for (all sorts of )
good things; and if he is touched by some evil, he is disappointed,
devoid of any hope.</item>
        <item>And if We give him a taste of some mercy from Us after
some hardship that has touched him, he will surely say, “This is my
right. And I do not think the Hour (the Day of Judgment) is going to
occur. And even if I am brought back to my Lord, I will surely have
the best (life) with Him (too).”So, We will let the disbelievers know
what they did, and let them taste a stern punishment.</item>
        <item>When We bestow Our favor upon man, he avoids (to
appreciate it) and keeps himself far aside (from obedience), and when
some evil touches him, he is full of lengthy prayers.</item>
        <item>Say (to the disbelievers), “Tell me, if it (the Qur’an)
is from Allah, and still you reject it, then who can be more erroneous
than him who is (involved) in far reaching schism?”</item>
        <item>We will show them Our signs in the universe and within
their own beings until it will become manifest to them that it is the
truth. ¹¹Is it not enough about your Lord that He is witness to
everything?</item>
        <item>Beware, they are in doubt about meeting their Lord.
Beware, He is the One who encompasses everything.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Ha Mim ¹</item>
        <item>Ain Sin Qaf ².</item>
        <item>This is how Allah, the Mighty, the Wise, sends
revelation to you and to those who were before you.</item>
        <item>To him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that
is in the earth, and He is the High, the Supreme.</item>
        <item>The heavens almost burst apart from their above side,
³and angels proclaim the purity and praise of their Lord, and pray for
forgiveness of those on the earth. Be aware that Allah is the MostForgiving, the Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>And those who have adopted patrons instead of Him, Allah
is on watch against them, and you are not responsible for them.</item>
        <item>And thus We have revealed to you an Arabic Qur’an, so
that you may warn the mother town, ⁴and those around it, and warn
(them) of the Day of Gathering, about which there is no doubt__(when)
one group of people will be in Paradise, and another group in blazing
Fire.</item>
        <item>Had Allah willed, He would have made all of them a
single group; but He admits whomsoever He wills into His mercy. As for
the wrongdoers, they have neither a patron nor a helper.</item>
        <item>Is it that they have adopted patrons instead of Him? So,
it is Allah who is the Patron, and He gives life to the dead, and He
is Powerful to do every thing.</item>
        <item>And (Say O prophet to your opponents,) “Whatever dispute
you have in any matter, its judgment lies with Allah. That One is
Allah, the Lord of mine; in Him alone I have placed my trust, and to
Him alone I turn (in every matter).”</item>
        <item>He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. He has
made for you pairs from among yourselves, and pairs from the cattle.
He makes you expand in this way. Nothing is like Him. And He is the
All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</item>
        <item>To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. He
extends provision for whomsoever He wills, and straitens (it for
whomsoever He wills). Surely He is All-Knowing in respect of every
thing.</item>
        <item>He has ordained for you people the same religion as He
had enjoined upon Nuh, and that which We have revealed to you (O
prophet,) and that which We had enjoined upon Ibrahim and Musa and
‘Isa by saying, “Establish the religion, and be not divided therein.”
Arduous for the mushriks (polytheists) is that to which you are
inviting them. Allah chooses (and pulls) toward Himself anyone He
wills, and guides to Himself anyone who turns to Him (to seek
guidance).</item>
        <item>And they were not divided, in jealousy with each other,
but after the knowledge had come to them. Had it not been for a word
that had come forth earlier from your Lord (and was effective) until a
specified time, the matter would have been decided between them. ⁵And
those who were made to inherit the Book after them are in confounding
doubt about it.</item>
        <item>So, (O prophet,) towards that (faith) invite (people),
and be steadfast as you are commanded, and do not follow their
desires, and say, “I believe in whatever book Allah has sent down. And
I have been ordered to do justice among you. Allah is our Lord and
your Lord. For us are our deeds, and for you, your deeds. There is no
argumentation between us and you. Allah will bring us together, and to
Him is the final return.”</item>
        <item>Those who argue about Allah after He has been responded
to, ⁶their argument is void in the sight of their Lord, and upon them
is wrath, and for them is a severe punishment.</item>
        <item>Allah is the One who has sent down the Book with truth,
and the Balance as well. And what can let you know? May be, the Hour
(the Day of Judgment) is near.</item>
        <item>Those who do not believe in it demand that it should
come soon, and those who believe are fearful of it, and they know for
sure that it is the truth. Be aware that those who dispute concerning
the Hour are wandering afar from the right path.</item>
        <item>Allah is kind to His servants. He gives provision to
whom He wills, and He is the Strong, the Mighty.</item>
        <item>Whoever intends (to have) the harvest of the Hereafter,
We will increase in his harvest; and whoever intends (to have) the
harvest of the world (only), We will give him thereof, while in the
Hereafter he will have no share.</item>
        <item>Is it that they have associate-gods who have prescribed
for them a religion that is not sanctioned by Allah? Had it not been
for a decisive word, the matter would have been decided between them
(here in this world). And of course, for the wrongdoers there is a
painful punishment (in the Hereafter).</item>
        <item>You will see the wrongdoers fearful of what they earned,
and it is sure to befall them. As for those who believed and did
righteous deeds, they will be in meadows of the Gardens. For them
there is, with their Lord, whatever they wish. That is the great
bounty.</item>
        <item>That is the good news that Allah gives to His servants
who believed and did righteous deeds. Say, “I do not ask you any fee
for it, except the love of kinship.” ⁷And whoever performs a good act,
We will increase for him goodness therein.⁸Surely Allah is MostForgiving, Very-Appreciative.</item>
        <item>Is it that they say, “He has forged a lie against
Allah”? So, if Allah wills, He may put a seal on your heart. ⁹And Allah
blots out falsehood and establishes truth with His words. Surely, He
is fully aware of what lies in the hearts.</item>
        <item>And He is the One who accepts repentance from His
servants and forgives evil deeds and knows whatever you do.</item>
        <item>And He responds to (the prayer of) those who believe and
do righteous deeds, and gives them more out of His grace. As for the
disbelievers, for them there is a severe punishment.</item>
        <item>Should Allah expand the provision for His servants (to
its full extent), they would spread mischief on earth; but He sends
down what He wills in (due) measure. Surely, with regard to His
slaves, He is All-Aware, Ever-Watchful.</item>
        <item>And He is the One who sends down rain after they have
lost hope, and He extends His mercy. And He is the Guardian, Worthy of
all praise.</item>
        <item>Among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the
earth and the creatures He has spread in them. He is Powerful to
assemble them whenever He so wills.</item>
        <item>Whatever hardship befalls you is because of what your
own hands have committed, while He overlooks many (of your faults).
</item>
        <item>You are not able to frustrate (Him) in the earth. And,
besides Allah, you have neither someone to protect, nor someone to
help.</item>
        <item>And among His signs are ships in the sea, like
mountains.</item>
        <item>If He so wills, He may stop the wind, and they stand
still on its surface. Surely in this, there are signs for everyone who
is ever patient, fully grateful.</item>
        <item>Or He may destroy them because of what they earned, and
may overlook many (whom He may save at least in this world),</item>
        <item>And (in such an event) those who raise disputes in Our
verses will come to know that there is no way for them to escape.
</item>
        <item>So, whatever thing has been given to you is an enjoyment
of the worldly life. And that which is with Allah is much better, and
much more durable for those who believe and place their trust in
Allah,</item>
        <item>And (for) those who abstain from the major sins and from
shameful acts; and (for those who) when they get angry, they forgive,
</item>
        <item>And those who have responded to their Lord (in
submission to Him), and have established Salah, and whose affairs are
(settled) with mutual consultation between them, and who spend out of
what We have given to them,</item>
        <item>And those who, when they are subjected to aggression,
defend themselves.</item>
        <item>The recompense of evil is evil like it. Then the one who
forgives and opts for compromise has his reward undertaken by Allah.
Surely, He does not like the unjust.</item>
        <item>The one who defends himself after having been wronged,
there is no blame on such people.</item>
        <item>Blame, in fact, is upon those who wrong people and make
mischief on earth unjustly. For such people there is a painful
punishment.</item>
        <item>And if one observes patience and forgives, it is, of
course, one of the courageous conducts.</item>
        <item>The one whom Allah lets go astray, there is no one for
him to protect thereafter. And you will see the wrongdoers, when they
will see the punishment, that they will say, “Is there any way to be
sent back (to the world)? ”</item>
        <item>And you will see them that they will be presented to it
(the Fire), downcast because of humiliation, looking with stealthy
glance. And those who believe will say, “The real losers are those who
have lost their own selves and their families on the Day of Judgment.”
Be aware that the wrongdoers are in lasting punishment.</item>
        <item>And for them there will not be any friends who may help
them besides Allah. And the one whom Allah lets go astray, for him
there is no way (to save himself).</item>
        <item>Respond to your Lord before there comes a day for which
there will be no reversal from Allah’s side. For you there will be
neither a refuge that day, nor an opportunity to question (Allah about
your fate).</item>
        <item>So, if they turn away, then We did not send you (O
Prophet,) as a supervisor over them. You are not responsible but for
conveying the message. And when We make man taste mercy from Us, he
rejoices with it, and if an evil befalls him because of what their
hands sent ahead, then man becomes ungrateful.</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the
earth. He creates what He wills. He grants females to whom He wills,
and grants males to whom He wills.</item>
        <item>Or He combines for them couples, both males and females,
and makes whom He wills barren. Surely, He is All-Knowing, VeryPowerful.</item>
        <item>It is not (possible) for a human being that Allah speaks
to him, except by way of revelation, or from behind a curtain, or that
He sends a messenger, and he reveals, with His permission, what He
wills. Surely, He is All-High, All-Wise. ¹⁰</item>
        <item>In similar way, We have revealed to you a Spirit ¹¹from
Our command. You did not know earlier what was the Book or what was
Iman (true faith), but We have made it (the Qur’an) a light with which
We guide whomsoever We will from among Our servants. And indeed you
are guiding (people) to a straight path,</item>
        <item>The path of Allah, the One to whom belongs all that is
in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Be aware that towards
Allah all matters shall finally return.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Ha Mim . ¹</item>
        <item>By the manifest Book,</item>
        <item>We have made it an Arabic Qur’an, so that you may
understand.</item>
        <item>And it is, in the Mother of the Book (the Preserved
Tablet) with us ², surely sublime, full of wisdom.</item>
        <item>Shall We then take the advice away from you because you
are a transgressing people?</item>
        <item>How many a messenger We have sent to the earlier people!
</item>
        <item>No messenger came to them, but they used to mock at him.
</item>
        <item>So We have destroyed those who were stronger than these
(people of Makkah) in power, and the example of the earlier people has
already passed.</item>
        <item>Should you ask them as to who has created the heavens
and the earth, they will certainly say, “They are created by the AllMighty, the All-Knowing,”</item>
        <item>The One who has made the earth a cradle for you, and has
made for you pathways therein, so that you may be guided,</item>
        <item>And the One who has sent down water from the sky in due
measure. Then We have revived with it a dead town. In the same way,
you will be brought forth (alive from the graves),</item>
        <item>And the One who has created all the pairs, and has made
for you the boats and the cattle that you ride, ³</item>
        <item>So that you may mount upon their back, then recall the
favour of your Lord after having mounted upon it and say, “Pure is the
One who has subjugated this for us, and We were not able to have
control over it,</item>
        <item>And of course, towards our Lord we have to
return.”</item>
        <item>They have attributed to Him (that He is composed of)
parts, (and that too) out of His servants. ⁴Surely, man is clearly
ungrateful.</item>
        <item>Is it that He has adopted daughters from those whom He
has created, and chosen you for (having) sons?</item>
        <item>When one of them is given the good news of (the birth
of) that which he has attributed to Rahman (i.e. the daughters), his
face turns black, and he becomes choked with sorrow.</item>
        <item>Is it that (Allah has chosen) those (as His offspring)
who are grown up in ornaments and who cannot express themselves in
debate clearly?</item>
        <item>They have held angels, who are the servants of Rahman,
as females. Have they witnessed their creation? Their testimony will
be recorded, and they will be questioned.</item>
        <item>They say, “Had the Rahman so willed, we would not have
worshipped them.” They have no knowledge of that. They do nothing but
make conjectures.</item>
        <item>Or have We given to them a book before this, and they
are adhering to it?</item>
        <item>Instead, they say, “We have found our fathers on a
certain way, and we are on their footprints, fully guided.”</item>
        <item>Similarly, We did not send a warner to a town before
you, but its affluent people said, “We have found our fathers on a
certain way, and we are following their footprints.”</item>
        <item>He said, “Even if I bring to you something better in
guidance than that on which you have found your fathers?” They said,
“We totally disbelieve in what you are sent with.”</item>
        <item>So, We took revenge from them. Now look, how was the end
of those who rejected (Our messengers).</item>
        <item>Recall) when Ibrahim said to his father and to his
people, “I disown that which you worship,</item>
        <item>Except the One who has originated me; so He will guide
me.”</item>
        <item>He made it a word lasting among his posterity, so that
they may return. ⁵</item>
        <item>But, I gave these and their fathers enjoyment, until the
truth came to them, and a messenger as well who explains (it).</item>
        <item>But when the truth came to them, they said, “This is
magic, and we totally disbelieve in it.”</item>
        <item>They say, “Why was this Qur’an not revealed on a great
man from (either of) the two towns?” ⁶</item>
        <item>Is it they who allocate the mercy of your Lord? We have
allocated among them their livelihood in the worldly life, and have
raised some of them over others in ranks, so that some of them may put
some others to work. And the mercy of your Lord is much better than
what they accumulate. ⁷</item>
        <item>Were it not that all people would become of a single
creed (i.e. disbelief), We would have caused, for those who disbelieve
in Rahman, roofs of their houses to be made of silver, and the stairs
as well, on which they would climb,</item>
        <item>And doors of their homes, and the coaches on which they
would recline,</item>
        <item>And (would have made some of these things) of goldornaments. And all this is nothing but an enjoyment of the worldly
life. And the Hereafter, with your Lord, is (destined) for the Godfearing. ⁸</item>
        <item>Whoever makes himself blind against the advice of
Rahman, We assign for him a devil who accompanies him all the time.
</item>
        <item>And they (the devils) prevent such people from the
(right) way, while they deem themselves to be on the right path,
</item>
        <item>Until when such a person will come to us, he will say
(to the devil), “Would that there were the distance of East and West
between me and you, because you were the worst companion.”</item>
        <item>And (it will be said to such people,) “Since you were
wrongdoers, it will never benefit you today that you are sharing the
punishment with each other.” ⁹</item>
        <item>So, can you (O prophet) make the deaf to hear, or can
you show the way to the blind and the one who is in open error?</item>
        <item>So, even if We take you away, We will surely take
vengeance on them.</item>
        <item>Or (if) We show you (in your life) that (punishment)
with which We have threatened them, then We have full control over
them. ¹⁰</item>
        <item>So, hold fast to that which has been revealed to you.
Surely, you are on the straight path.</item>
        <item>And certainly this (Qur’an) is a word of honour for you
and your people, and you will be questioned. ¹¹</item>
        <item>Ask Our messengers whom We sent before you whether We
had appointed gods to be worshipped besides Rahman.</item>
        <item>We sent Musa with Our signs to Fir’aun (Pharaoh) and his
chiefs; so he said, “I am the messenger of the Lord of the
worlds.”</item>
        <item>So, when he came to them with Our signs, they at once
started laughing at them.</item>
        <item>And We did not show them a sign, but it used to be
greater than the one that preceded it. And We seized them with
punishment, so that they may return.</item>
        <item>And they said, “O magician, pray for us to your Lord by
the covenant He has made with you; we will certainly come to
guidance.”</item>
        <item>Then, once We removed the punishment from them, in no
time they broke their promise.</item>
        <item>And Fir’aun (Pharaoh) proclaimed among his people,
saying, “Does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me, and these rivers
are flowing right underneath me? Do you, then, not discern?</item>
        <item>Or (do you not see that) I am much better than this one
(Musa) who is worthless and can hardly express himself?</item>
        <item>So why were the bracelets of gold not sent down to him,
or (why) did the angels not come along with him as companions?”</item>
        <item>Thus he made fool of his people, and they obeyed him.
Surely they were a sinful people. ¹²</item>
        <item>So, when they provoked Our anger, We took vengeance on
them, and drowned them all together,</item>
        <item>And made them a people of the past, and an example for
the later generations.</item>
        <item>When the example of the son of Maryam was cited, your
people started at once shouting at it (in joy),</item>
        <item>And said, “Are Our gods better or is he?” ¹³They did not
cite it (the example) but for the sake of disputation. Rather, they
are a quarrelsome people.</item>
        <item>He (‘Isa) is no more than a servant (of Allah) whom We
favoured and made an example for the children of Isra’il.</item>
        <item>And if We will, We may create angels from you who
succeed you on the earth. ¹⁴</item>
        <item>And he (‘Isa) is a source of knowledge of the Hour (the
Day of Judgment); ¹⁵so do not be in doubt about it, and follow me. This
is the straight way.</item>
        <item>And let not the Shaitan (Satan) prevent you (from
following this way). He is surely an open enemy for you.</item>
        <item>When ‘Isa came with clear proofs, he said, “I have come
to you with wisdom, and to explain to you some of those matters in
which you differ. So, fear Allah, and obey me.</item>
        <item>Surely, it is Allah who is my Lord and your Lord; so
worship Him. This is the straight way.”</item>
        <item>Then different groups, out of them, fell into
disagreement. Woe to the wrongdoers because of the punishment of a
painful day!</item>
        <item>They are waiting for nothing but for the Hour to come
upon them suddenly, while they would not even imagine (it).</item>
        <item>Friends, on that day, will become enemies to one
another, except the God-fearing,</item>
        <item>To whom it will be said) “O my servants, there is no
fear for you today, nor will you grieve_</item>
        <item>O those (servants) who believed in Our signs, and
remained obedient.</item>
        <item>Enter the Paradise, you and your spouses, showered with
bliss.”</item>
        <item>Circulated among them will be the bowls of gold, and
glasses. And there will be whatever souls desire and that which eyes
enjoy. “And you will be living in it for ever.</item>
        <item>That is the Paradise you are made to inherit because of
what you used to do.</item>
        <item>For you there are fruits in abundance from which you
will eat.”</item>
        <item>The sinners (on the other hand) will be in the
punishment of Jahannam (Hell), living there forever.</item>
        <item>It will not be lightened for them, and they will be
there, devoid of all hopes.</item>
        <item>We did not do injustice to them, rather, they themselves
were the unjust.</item>
        <item>And they will call (Malik, the keeper of the Hell,) “O
Malik, let your Lord do away with us.” He will say, “You have to stay
on.”</item>
        <item>O disbelievers,) indeed We have brought to you the
truth, but it is the truth that most of you detest.</item>
        <item>Is it that they have firmly resolved to do something
(harmful to Our messenger)? Then, We have firmly resolved (to
frustrate their plan.)</item>
        <item>Do they think that We do not hear their secrets and
their whispers? Yes of course, Our messengers (angels) are with them
who record (whatever they plan).</item>
        <item>Say, “Had there been a son for the Rahman, I would have
been the first to worship.” ¹⁶</item>
        <item>Pure is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord
of the Throne, from what they attribute (to Him).</item>
        <item>So, let them indulge (in their fallacy) and play, until
they face their Day that they are promised.</item>
        <item>He is the One who is God to be worshipped in the sky,
and God to be worshipped on the earth. And He is the Wise, the AllKnowing.</item>
        <item>Glorious is the One to whom belongs the kingdom of the
heavens and the earth and whatever lies between them. With Him is the
knowledge of the Hour; and towards Him you are to be returned.</item>
        <item>And those whom they invoke besides Him have no power to
intercede; but those who bear witness to the truth, while they have
knowledge (may intercede for the believers with Allah’s permission).
</item>
        <item>And if you ask them as to who has created them, they
will certainly say, “Allah”. Then, to where are they driven back (by
their false desires)?</item>
        <item>And (Allah has the knowledge) of his (prophet’s) saying,
“O my Lord, these are a people who do not believe.” ¹⁷</item>
        <item>So, turn away from them, and say, “Salam !” (good-bye!).
Then, soon they will come to know (the end of their attitude).</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Ha Mim . ¹</item>
        <item>By the manifest Book,</item>
        <item>We have sent it down in a blessed night, (because) We
had to warn (people).</item>
        <item>In that (night), every wise matter is allocated</item>
        <item>Through a command from Us. ²We were to send the
Messenger</item>
        <item>As a mercy from your Lord, __Surely, He is the All-
Hearing, the All-Knowing___</item>
        <item>The Lord of the heavens and the earth and of whatever
there is between them, if you are to believe.</item>
        <item>There is no god, but He. He gives life and brings death.
He is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.</item>
        <item>But they, being in doubt, are playing around.</item>
        <item>So, wait for a day when the sky will come up with a
visible smoke</item>
        <item>That will envelop people. This is a painful punishment.
</item>
        <item>Then they will say,) “O our Lord, remove from us the
punishment; we will truly believe.” ³</item>
        <item>How will they take lesson, while there has already come
to them a messenger making things clear?</item>
        <item>Then they turned away from him, and said, “(He is)
tutored, crazy.”</item>
        <item>Well,) We are going to remove the punishment for a
while, (but) you will certainly go back (to your original position).
</item>
        <item>Then,) the day We will seize (you) with the greatest
seizure, We will take vengeance.</item>
        <item>And We tested the people of Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) prior to
them, and a noble messenger came to them</item>
        <item>Saying, “Deliver to me the servants of Allah. ⁴I am an
honest messenger to you,”</item>
        <item>And saying, “Do not be haughty against Allah. I bring to
you a clear proof.</item>
        <item>And I have sought refuge with my Lord and your Lord,
lest you stone me to death.</item>
        <item>And if you do not believe in me, then keep away from
me.”</item>
        <item>Then he prayed to his Lord saying, “These are a guilty
people.”</item>
        <item>So, Allah answered his prayer saying,) “Now, take away
my servants at night. You will certainly be chased,</item>
        <item>And leave the sea in the state of stillness; they are an
army that is sure to be drowned.”</item>
        <item>How many gardens and fountains have they left
behind_</item>
        <item>And how many fields and noble sites,</item>
        <item>And how many a luxury they used to rejoice in!</item>
        <item>This is how it happened. And We made other people
inherit all this.</item>
        <item>So, neither the sky and earth wept over them, nor were
they given a respite.</item>
        <item>And We delivered the children of Isra’il from the
humiliating punishment,</item>
        <item>From Fir‘aun. Indeed, he was haughty, one of the
transgressors.</item>
        <item>And We chose them, with knowledge, ⁵above all the worlds.
</item>
        <item>And We gave them the clear signs in which there was a
manifest blessing.</item>
        <item>These people say,</item>
        <item>There is nothing more than our first death, and we are
not going to be resurrected.</item>
        <item>So, (O believers,) bring our fathers, if you are true
(in your belief in resurrection.)”</item>
        <item>Are they better or the people of Tubba‘ ⁶and those who
were before them? We have destroyed them. They were guilty indeed.
</item>
        <item>And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what
is between them just as players.</item>
        <item>We did not create them but with true purpose, but most
of them do not know.</item>
        <item>The Day of Decision is the appointed time for all of
them__</item>
        <item>The day when no close relation will be of any use to any
close relation, nor will they be helped,</item>
        <item>Except the One on whom Allah has mercy. Of course, He is
the All-Mighty, the Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Indeed the tree of zaqqum</item>
        <item>Is the food of the sinful, ⁷</item>
        <item>Like dregs of oil. It will boil in the bellies</item>
        <item>Like the boiling of hot water.</item>
        <item>It will be said to angels,) “Seize him, and drag him
into the midst of the Hell.</item>
        <item>Then pour on his head some torment of boiling
water.”</item>
        <item>Have a taste! You are the ‘man of might’, the ‘man of
honour’. ⁸</item>
        <item>This is the thing about which you used to be
skeptic.”</item>
        <item>Indeed the God-fearing will be in a place free from
fear,</item>
        <item>In gardens and fountains.</item>
        <item>They will be dressed in fine silk and thick silk, facing
each other.</item>
        <item>Thus (it will happen,) and We will marry them with
houris having big dark eyes.</item>
        <item>They will call therein for every fruit peacefully.
</item>
        <item>They will not taste death therein beyond the first death
(they faced in the world). And He (Allah) will save them from the
torment of Hell,</item>
        <item>As a favour from your Lord. That is the great
achievement.</item>
        <item>So, We had made it (the Qur’an) easy in your tongue, so
that they may take lesson.</item>
        <item>Now wait. They too are waiting.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Ha Mim . ¹</item>
        <item>This is revelation of the Book from Allah, the AllMighty, the All-Wise.</item>
        <item>Surely in the heavens and the earth, there are signs for
those who have faith.</item>
        <item>And in your creation and in the living beings that He
scatters on the earth, there are signs for a people who believe.
</item>
        <item>And in the alternation of the day and the night, and in
the provision He has sent down from the sky, then has revived the
earth after its death, and in changing of the winds, there are signs
for a people who understand.</item>
        <item>These are Allah’s verses that We recite to you rightly.
Then, in which discourse, after Allah and His verses, will they
believe?</item>
        <item>Woe to every sinful liar,</item>
        <item>Who hears Allah’s verses being recited to him, then he
remains adamant out of arrogance, as if he never heard them. So give
him the ‘good news’ of a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>When he learns about something of Our verses, he takes
it as a laughing stock. For such people, there is a humiliating
punishment.</item>
        <item>In front of them, there is Jahannam (Hell). And whatever
they have earned will not be of any use to them, nor the patrons they
have adopted instead of Allah. And for them, there is a horrible
punishment.</item>
        <item>This is guidance, and those who reject the verses of
their Lord, for them there is a painful punishment of the divine
scourge.</item>
        <item>Allah is the One who has subjugated for you the sea, so
that the ships may sail in it with His command, and so that you may
seek His grace ², and so that you offer gratitude.</item>
        <item>He has subjugated for you whatever there is in the
heavens and whatever there is in the earth, all on His own. Surely in
this there are signs for a people who reflect.</item>
        <item>Tell those who believe that they should forgive those
who do not believe in Allah’s days, ³so that He may recompense a
people for what they used to earn.</item>
        <item>Whoever acts righteously, it is for his own benefit, and
who does evil, it is against his own soul. Then towards your Lord, you
will be returned.</item>
        <item>We gave the children of Isra’il the book and the wisdom
and the prophet-hood, and provided them with good things, and
preferred them above all (people of) the world,</item>
        <item>And We gave them clear proofs of the Matter (i.e. the
religion). So they did not fall into disagreement out of mutual
jealousy, but after the knowledge had come to them. Surely your Lord
will judge between them, on the Day of Judgment, in the matters in
which they used to differ.</item>
        <item>Then We have put you on a certain way of the Matter
(i.e. the religion); ⁴so follow it, and do not follow the desires of
those who do not know.</item>
        <item>They will never help you against Allah in the least. The
wrongdoers are friends to one another, and Allah is the friend of the
God-fearing.</item>
        <item>These are insights for the people, and guidance and
mercy for a people who believe.</item>
        <item>Do those who have committed evils assume that We will
make them like those who believe and do righteous deeds, so as their
life and death becomes equal? Evil is what they judge. ⁵</item>
        <item>Allah has created the heavens and the earth with just
purpose, and so that everybody is recompensed for what he (or she)
earned, and they will not be wronged.</item>
        <item>So, have you seen him who has taken his desires as his
god, and Allah has let him go astray, despite having knowledge, and
has sealed his ear and his heart, and put a cover on his eye? Now who
will guide him after Allah? Still, do you not take lesson?</item>
        <item>And they say, “There is no life but our worldly life. We
die and live, and nothing destroys us except time.” They have no
knowledge about that; they do nothing but make conjectures.</item>
        <item>When Our verses are recited to them in all their
clarity, their argument is none but that they say, “Bring our fathers,
if you are truthful.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Allah gives you life, then makes you die, then He
will assemble you on the Day of Judgement in which there is no doubt,
but most of the people do not know.</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the
earth. The day the Hour will take place, it will be the day in which
the adherents of falsehood shall lose,</item>
        <item>And you will see every community kneeling down. Every
community will be called to its book (of record). Today you will be
recompensed for what you used to do.</item>
        <item>This is Our book that speaks against you with truth. We
used to get recorded all that you used to do.</item>
        <item>Then, as for those who believed and did righteous deeds,
their Lord will admit them to His mercy. That is indeed the
achievement, visible to all.</item>
        <item>And as to those who disbelieved, (it will be said to
them,) “Had My verses not been recited to you? But you showed
arrogance, and you were a guilty people;</item>
        <item>And when it was said to you that Allah’s promise is true
and there is no doubt in the (arrival of the) Hour, you used to say,
‘We do not know what the Hour is. We do not think (about it) but as an
assumption, and we are not sure.’”</item>
        <item>And revealed to them will be the evils of what they did,
and encircled they will be by what they used to ridicule.</item>
        <item>It will be said, “Today We will forget you, as you
forgot facing this your day, and your abode is the Fire, and for you
there are no helpers at all.</item>
        <item>That is because you took Allah’s verses as a laughing
stock, and the worldly life deceived you.” So today they will neither
be brought out of it, nor will they be asked to repent.</item>
        <item>So, to Allah belongs all praise, who is the Lord of the
heavens and the earth, the Lord of the worlds.</item>
        <item>And to Him belongs majesty in the heavens and the earth.
And He is the Mighty, the Wise.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Ha Mim . ¹</item>
        <item>This is revelation of the book from Allah, the AllMighty, the All-Wise.</item>
        <item>We did not create the heavens and the earth but with
true purpose and for a specified term. But those who disbelieve are
averse to what they are warned of.</item>
        <item>Say, “Tell me about those whom you invoke instead of
Allah, (and) show me what they have created from the earth; Or have
they a share in (the creation of) the heavens? Bring to me a book
(revealed) before this one, or a trace of knowledge, if you are
truthful.”</item>
        <item>Who is more astray than him who invokes, instead of
Allah, those who will not respond to him up to the Day of Judgement;
and they are totally unaware of their prayers,</item>
        <item>And when people will be assembled (on the Day of
Judgment), they will be enemies to them, and will refuse even their
having worshipped them.</item>
        <item>When Our verses are recited to them in all their
clarity, the disbelievers say about the truth when it comes to them,
“This is an open magic.”</item>
        <item>Is it that they say, “He has forged it (the Qur’an)”?
Say, “If I have forged it, then you do not have any power to help me
against Allah. He is well aware of what you are engaged in. He is
enough as a witness between me and you, and He is the Most-Forgiving,
the Very-Merciful.”</item>
        <item>Say, “I am not something unprecedented among the
messengers, and I do not know what will be done to me or to you. ²I do
not follow anything but what is revealed to me, and I am only a clear
warner.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Tell me, If it (the Qur’an) is from Allah and you
reject it, and a witness from the children of Isra’il testifies about
something similar to it and comes to believe (in it), while you
persist in your arrogance, (then, how unjust you are!) ³Surely, Allah
does not give guidance to the unjust people.</item>
        <item>The disbelievers say about the believers, “Had it
(Islamic faith) been a good thing, these (weak and poor) people would
not have preceded us (in proceeding) towards it.” Since they did not
accept guidance through it (the Qur’an), they will say, “This is a
classical lie.”</item>
        <item>And before this there was the Book of Musa, a guide and
a mercy. And this is a Book confirming (it) in Arabic tongue, so that
it may warn the wrongdoers and give good news to those who are good in
their deeds.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who say, “Our Lord is Allah” and then stay
firm, they will have no fear, nor shall they grieve.</item>
        <item>Those are the people of Paradise, who will live there
for ever as a reward for what they used to do.</item>
        <item>And We have enjoined upon man to do good to his parents.
His mother carried him with difficulty and delivered him with
difficulty. And his carrying and his weaning is (in) thirty months, ⁴
until when he attains his maturity and reaches forty years, he says,
“My Lord, grant me that I offer gratitude for the favour You have
bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I do righteous deeds
that You like. And set righteousness, for my sake, in my progeny. Of
course, I repent to yo</item>
        <item>Such are the people from whom We accept the best of what
they did, and overlook their evil deeds, (so as they will be) among
the people of Paradise according to the true promise that was made to
them.</item>
        <item>And (Contrary to this is the case of) the one who said
to his parents, “Fie upon you both! Do you promise to me that I shall
be brought out (from the grave), while generations have passed before
me?” And they (the parents) were crying for Allah’s help, (and saying
to their son,) “Woe to you. Accept the true faith. Allah’s promise is
certainly true.” Then he says, “This is nothing but the tales of the
ancients.”</item>
        <item>Such are the people on whom the word (of punishment) has
come true along with the communities of the Jinn and the humans that
have passed before them. Surely they were losers.</item>
        <item>For each (of these two groups) there are (different)
ranks because of what they did, and so that He may repay them in full
for their deeds; and they will not be wronged.</item>
        <item>And the day the disbelievers will be presented before
the Fire, (it will be said to them,) “You have consumed your good
things in your worldly life, and have enjoyed them. So, you will be
punished today with the torment of humiliation for the arrogance you
used to show on earth with no right (to do so), and for the sins you
used to commit.</item>
        <item>And recall the brother of (the nation of) ‘Ad, when he
warned his people at the long, curved sand dunes__ while many warners
have passed before him and after him (with the same message)__saying,
“Do not worship anyone except Allah. Surely I fear for you the
punishment of a terrible day.”</item>
        <item>They said, “Have you come to make us deviate from our
gods? So bring us that with which you are threatening us, if you are
truthful.”</item>
        <item>He said, “The knowledge is with Allah alone, and I am
conveying to you what I am sent with, but I see you are a people who
act ignorantly.”</item>
        <item>So, when they saw it as a cloud proceeding towards their
valleys, they said, “This is a cloud that will bring us rain.” No, it
is the very thing you asked to hasten up __ a wind in which there is a
painful punishment,</item>
        <item>That will destroy every thing with the command of its
Lord! So they became such that nothing remained to be seen except
their dwelling places. ⁵This is how We punish the guilty people.</item>
        <item>And indeed We had established them in a powerful
position in which We did not establish you (O people of Makkah), and
had given to them ears and eyes and hearts, but neither their ears
benefited them in the least, nor their eyes, nor their hearts, as they
used to reject Allah’s signs; and they were encircled by what they
used to ridicule.</item>
        <item>And We have (also) destroyed (other) towns around you,
⁶while We had given to them a variety of signs, so that they might
return (from disbelief).</item>
        <item>So, why is it that they were not helped by those whom
they had taken as gods beside Allah in order to attain closeness (to
Him)? Instead, they vanished from them. That was, in fact, their
falsity and a thing they used to fabricate.</item>
        <item>And (recall) when We directed a group of Jinns towards
you, listening to the Qur’an. ⁷So, when they attended it, they said (to
each other), “Keep quiet.” Then once it was over, they went back to
their people as warners.</item>
        <item>They said, “O our people, we have heard a book sent down
after Musa, ⁸confirming what was before it, which guides to the truth
and to a straight path.</item>
        <item>O our people, respond to Allah’s herald, and believe in
him, and (once you do that,) Allah will forgive your sins for you, and
will save you from a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>The one who does not respond to Allah’s herald is not
(able) to frustrate (Allah by escaping) in the land, and for him there
are no supporters besides Him. Such people are in open error.</item>
        <item>Have they not seen that Allah who has created the
heavens and the earth, and was not wearied by their creation, does
have power to give life to the dead? Yes of course, He is powerful to
do every thing.</item>
        <item>The day the disbelievers will be presented to the Fire,
(it will be said to them,) “Is this not true?” They will say, “Yes of
course, Our Lord!” He will say, “Then taste the punishment, for you
used to disbelieve.”</item>
        <item>So, (O prophet,) observe patience, as the resolute
messengers observed patience, and be not in haste about them. The Day
they will see what they are promised, (it will be) as if they did not
stay (in the world) more than an hour in a single day. This is a
message. So, none will be destroyed except the sinners.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieved, and prevented (others) from
Allah’s way, He (Allah) has rendered their deeds vain. ¹</item>
        <item>And those who believed and did righteous deeds and
believed in that which is revealed to Muhammad,_and it is the truth
(that has come) from their Lord__He will write off their evil deeds,
and will set aright their state of affairs.</item>
        <item>That is because the disbelievers have followed
falsehood, while the believers have followed the truth (that has come)
from their Lord. This is how Allah explains their (respective)
situations to the people.</item>
        <item>So, when you encounter those who disbelieve, then (aim
at) smiting the necks, until when you have broken their strength
thoroughly, then tie fast the bond, (by making them captives). Then
choose (to release them) either (as) a favour (shown to them,), or
(after receiving) ransom, ² until the war throws down its load of
arms. ³ That (is Our command.) If Allah willed, He would have
(Himself) subjected them to retribution, but (Allah ordered you to
fight,) so that He may test some of you through some others.⁴ And those
who are killed in Allah’s way, He will never let their deeds go to
waste.</item>
        <item>Instead,) He will guide them, and will set aright their
state of affairs,</item>
        <item>And will admit them to the Paradise He has identified
for them.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, if you will help (the religion
prescribed by) Allah, He will help you, and will stabilize your
footings.</item>
        <item>As for those who disbelieve, (destined) for them is
destruction, and He has rendered their deeds vain.</item>
        <item>That is because they hate what Allah has sent down;
therefore Allah has nullified their deeds.</item>
        <item>Have they not travelled in the land so that they might
see how was the end of those before them? Allah brought utter
destruction to them. And (ready) for (these) disbelievers are the
likes thereof.</item>
        <item>That is because Allah is the supporter of those who
believe. As for the disbelievers, there is no supporter for them.
</item>
        <item>Surely, Allah will admit those who believe and do good
deeds to the gardens beneath which rivers flow. As for those who
disbelieve, they enjoy (the worldly life), and eat as cattle eat, and
the Fire is the final abode for them.</item>
        <item>How many a town, stronger in might than your town that
has expelled you, have We destroyed! Then, there was none to help
them.</item>
        <item>Then, can one who holds on to a clear proof from his
Lord be like those for whom their evil deeds are beautified, and who
followed their desires?</item>
        <item>Here is) a description of the Paradise that is promised
for the God-fearing! In it there are rivers of water, never spoiling,
and rivers of milk the taste of which would not go bad, and rivers of
wine, delicious to the drinkers, and rivers of honey, fully purified.
And for them there are all sorts of fruits, and forgiveness from their
Lord. Are they like those who will live in Fire forever, and will be
given boiling water to drink, and it will tear their bowels into
pieces?</item>
        <item>Among them there are ones who (pretend to) give ear to
you, until when they go out from your presence, they say to those who
have been given knowledge, “What did he say just now?” ⁵ Those are the
ones on whose hearts Allah has put a seal, and they have followed
their desires.</item>
        <item>As for those who have adopted right path, Allah improves
them in guidance, and gives them their piety.</item>
        <item>They are waiting for nothing but for the Hour (of Doom)
that it should come upon them suddenly. So, its signs have already
come. Then, once it will come upon them, how would they have an
opportunity to accept the advice (already) given to them?</item>
        <item>So, be assured that there is no god but Allah, and seek
forgiveness for your fault, and for (the faults of) the believing men
and believing women. And Allah knows your moving from place to place
and your permanent abode.</item>
        <item>And the believers say, “Why has a (new) Surah not been
revealed?” ⁶ Then, once an operative Surah is sent down, and fighting
(in Allah’s way) is mentioned in it, you notice those who have disease
in their hearts, looking to you like one who is faint because of
death. So, destruction is very close to them.</item>
        <item>The (reality of their) obedience and (truthfulness of
their) speech is fully known (as being mere deception). So, had they
been truthful to Allah when the matter had become serious,⁷ it would
have been much better for them.</item>
        <item>So, (O hypocrites,) do you not apprehend that, in case
you turn away (from Jihad ), you will spread disorder in the land and
will sever your ties of kinship? ⁸</item>
        <item>Those are the ones whom Allah has cursed; so He has made
them deaf, and made their eyes blind.</item>
        <item>Then, do they not give serious thought to the Qur’an, or
do they have locks on their hearts?</item>
        <item>Surely those who turn back after the guidance has
appeared to them clearly, it is Satan who has tempted them and
involved them in far-fetched fancies.</item>
        <item>That is because they say to those who hate that which
Allah has revealed, “We will obey you in some respects.” ⁹ And Allah
knows their secret talk.</item>
        <item>So, how (miserable) will they be when the angels will
exact their souls, smiting their faces and their backs?</item>
        <item>That is because they followed that which has angered
Allah, and they disliked His pleasure; therefore He has nullified
their deeds.</item>
        <item>Do those having malady in their hearts think that Allah
will never expose their grudges (against Islam)?</item>
        <item>Had We willed, We would have shown them to you (by
identifying each one of them,) so as you would definitely recognize
them by their features. However, you will recognize them by the tone
of (their) speech. ¹⁰ And Allah knows (all) your deeds.</item>
        <item>And We will certainly test you until We know those of
you who carry out Jihad (struggle in Allah’s way) and observe
patience, and until We check your episodes.</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieve and prevent (others) from Allah’s
way, and oppose the Messenger, after the Guidance has appeared to them
clearly, shall never bring harm to Allah in the least, and He will
render their deeds vain.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger,
and do not nullify your deeds.</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieved and prevented (others) from
Allah’s way, then died as disbelievers, Allah will never forgive them.
</item>
        <item>So, do not lose heart, and do not appeal for peace; ¹¹
you will be the uppermost, and Allah is with you; and He will never
deprive you of your deeds.</item>
        <item>The worldly life is but play and pastime. If you believe
and be God-fearing, He will give you your rewards, and will not ask
you your riches.</item>
        <item>If He were to ask you of it, and press you (to spend all
your wealth), you would show miserliness, and He would expose your
disgusts. ¹²</item>
        <item>Yes, you are such that you are called upon to spend in
Allah’s way, but some of you withhold in miserliness_ and he who
withholds in miserliness withholds against himself_ and Allah is the
Need-Free, and you are the needy. And if you turn away, He will
replace you by some other people, then they will not be like you.
</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Surely, We have granted you an open victory, ¹</item>
        <item>So that Allah may forgive you of your previous and
subsequent faults, ²and may complete His favour upon you, and may
guide you to a straight path,</item>
        <item>And so that Allah may support you with a mighty support.
</item>
        <item>He (Allah) is such that He sent down tranquility into
the hearts of the believers, so that they grow more in faith in
addition to their (existing) faith__ And to Allah belong the forces of
the heavens and the earth, and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise__</item>
        <item>So that He admits believing men and believing women to
the gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live therein for ever, and
so that He may write off their evil deeds, which is a great
achievement in Allah’s sight,</item>
        <item>And so that He may punish the hypocrites, men and women,
and the mushriks (polytheists), men and women, who think evil thoughts
about Allah. Bound for them there is a vicious circle, and Allah has
become angry with them, and He has prepared Jahannam (Hell) for them,
and it is an evil destination.</item>
        <item>To Allah belong the forces of the heavens and the earth,
and Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>Indeed, We have sent you (O prophet,) as a witness and
as a bearer of good news and as a warner,</item>
        <item>So that you (O people,) believe in Allah and His
Messenger, and support him and revere him, and pronounce His (Allah’s)
purity morning and evening.</item>
        <item>Those who pledge allegiance with you (by placing their
hands in your hand)__ they, in fact, pledge allegiance with Allah.
Allah’s hand is over their hands. Then, whoever breaks his pledge
breaks it to his own detriment, and whoever fulfils the covenant he
has made with Allah, He will give him a great reward.</item>
        <item>Those of the Bedouins who remained behind ³will say to
you, “Our possessions and our families kept us busy, (hence we could
not accompany you in your journey to Hudaibiyah). So, pray to Allah
for our forgiveness.” They say with their tongues what is not in their
hearts. Say, “Then, who has power to help you in any thing against
Allah, if He intends to do you harm, or intends to do you good?
Rather, Allah is fully aware of what you do.</item>
        <item>But you thought that the Messenger and the believers
would never ever return to their families, and it seemed good to your
hearts, and you thought an evil thought and became a people who are
ruined (by their selfishness).”</item>
        <item>If one does not believe in Allah and His Messenger, then
We have prepared a blazing fire for the disbelievers.</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the
earth. He forgives whomsoever He wills, and punishes whomsoever He
wills. And Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Those who remained behind will say, when you will
proceed to the spoils (of war) to receive them, “Let us follow you.”
⁴They wish to change the words of Allah. Say, “You shall not follow us.
Allah had said like this beforehand.” ⁵Then they will say, “No, but you
are jealous of us.” On the contrary, they do not understand (the
reality) but a little.</item>
        <item>Say to those of the Bedouins who remained behind, “You
will be called against a people possessed of strong fighting power;
you will have to fight them until they submit. ⁶So if you obey, Allah
will give you a good reward, and if you turn away, as you had turned
away earlier, He will punish you with a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>There is no blame on the blind, nor is there any blame
on the lame, nor is there any blame on the sick. Whoever obeys Allah
and His Messenger, He will admit him to the gardens beneath which
rivers flow. But whoever turns away, He will punish him with a painful
punishment.</item>
        <item>Allah was pleased with the believers when they were
pledging allegiance with you (by placing their hands in your hands)
under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down
tranquility upon them, and rewarded them with a victory, near at hand,
⁷</item>
        <item>And many spoils that they would receive. And Allah is
Mighty, Wise.</item>
        <item>Allah had promised you many spoils that you would
receive, so He gave these to you sooner, and stopped the hands of the
people from (harming) you. ⁸And (He did this) so that it becomes a sign
for believers, and so that He guides you to the right path.</item>
        <item>And (there is) another (victory) that has not come
within your power as yet, (but) Allah has encompassed it. ⁹And Allah is
Powerful over every thing.</item>
        <item>Had the disbelievers fought you, ¹⁰ they would have
certainly turned their backs, then they would have found neither a
supporter nor a helper_</item>
        <item>According to the consistent practice of Allah that went
on since before, and you will never find a change in Allah’s
consistent practice.</item>
        <item>And He is the One who restrained their hands from you
and your hands from them in the valley of Makkah after He had let you
prevail over them, and Allah is watchful over what you do.</item>
        <item>They are those who disbelieved and prevented you from
the Sacred Mosque (Al-Masjid-ul-Haram ), and (prevented) the
sacrificial animals that were detained from reaching their due place.
And (Allah would have allowed you to fight,) had there not been
believing men and believing women whom you did not know that you might
have trampled them, and thus a painful situation might have arisen for
you because of them unknowingly; (This situation was avoided) so that
Allah may admit to His mercy whom He wills.And if they (the believing
men and women) had moved (from Makkah), We would surely have punished
those of them who disbelieved with a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>When the disbelievers developed in their hearts
indignation, the indignation of ignorance; then Allah sent down
tranquility from Himself upon His Messenger and upon the believers,
and made them stick to the word of piety, and they were very much
entitled to it and competent for it. And Allah is All-Knowing about
every thing.</item>
        <item>Indeed, Allah has made true to His Messenger the dream
(shown) with truth: ¹¹You will definitely enter the Sacred Mosque
insha’allah (if Allah wills,) peacefully, with your heads shaved, and
your hairs cut short, having no fear. So He knew what you did not
know, and He assigned before that a victory, near at hand. ¹²</item>
        <item>He is the One who has sent His Messenger with Guidance
and the religion of truth, so that He makes it prevail over all
religions. And enough is Allah for being a witness (to His promise).
</item>
        <item>Muahmmad is the messenger of Allah, and those who are
with him are hard on the disbelievers, compassionate among themselves;
you will see them bowing down in Ruku‘, prostrating themselves in
Sajdah, seeking grace from Allah, and (His) good pleasure; their
distinguishing feature is on their faces from the effect of Sajdah
(prostration). This is their description in Torah; ¹³ and their
description in Injil is: like a sown crop that brings forth its shoot,
then makes it strong, then</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not proceed ahead of Allah and His
Messenger, ¹and fear Allah. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not raise your voices above the
voice of the Prophet, and be not loud when speaking to him, as you are
loud when speaking to one another, lest your good deeds should become
void while you are not aware.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who lower their voices before Allah’s
Messenger are the ones whose hearts Allah has tested for piety; for
them there is forgiveness, and a great reward.</item>
        <item>As for those who call you from behind the chambers, most
of them have no sense. ²</item>
        <item>Had they remained patient until you come out to them, it
would have been much better for them. And Allah is Most-Forgiving,
Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, if a sinful person brings you a
report, verify its correctness, lest you should harm a people out of
ignorance, and then become remorseful on what you did.</item>
        <item>And know that among you there is the Messenger of Allah.
If he obeys you in many a matter, you will certainly fall into
hardship. ³But Allah has endeared to you the Faith, and made it
beautiful in your hearts, and made detestable to you the disbelief and
sins and disobedience. Such people are rightly guided,</item>
        <item>As a grace from Allah, and as a blessing. And Allah is
All-Knowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>If two groups of the believers fight each other, seek
reconciliation between them. And if one of them commits aggression
against the other, fight the one that commits aggression until it
comes back to Allah’s command. So if it comes back, seek
reconciliation between them with fairness, and maintain justice.
Surely Allah loves those who maintain justice.</item>
        <item>All believers are but brothers, therefore seek
reconciliation between your two brothers, and fear Allah, so that you
may be blessed with mercy.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, no men should ever scoff at other
men. May be, the latter are better than the former. Nor should women
(ever scoff) at other women. May be, the latter women are better than
the former ones. And do not find fault with one another, nor call one
another with bad nicknames. Bad is the name of sinfulness after
embracing Faith. ⁴If anyone does not repent, then such people are the
wrongdoers.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, abstain from many of the suspicions.
Some suspicions are sins. ⁵And do not be curious (to find out faults of
others), and do not backbite one another. Does one of you like that he
eats the flesh of his dead brother? You would abhor it. ⁶And fear
Allah. Surely Allah is Most-Relenting, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>O mankind, We have created you from a male and a female,
and made you into races and tribes, so that you may identify one
another. Surely the noblest of you, in Allah’s sight, is the one who
is most pious of you. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.</item>
        <item>The Bedouins say, “We have come to believe.” Say, “You
have not come to believe; instead, you (should) say, ‘We have
surrendered’ and the belief has not entered your hearts so far. ⁷If you
obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not curtail (the reward of) any
of your deeds in the least. Surely Allah is Most-Forgiving, VeryMerciful.”</item>
        <item>Believers, in fact, are those who believe in Allah and
His Messenger, then have no doubt, and struggle, with their riches and
their lives, in the way of Allah. Those are the truthful.</item>
        <item>Say, “Would you apprise Allah of your religion, while
Allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth,
and Allah is All-Knowing about every thing?”</item>
        <item>They oblige you that they have accepted Islam, (as if it
was a favour shown to you). Say, “Do not oblige me for your accepting
Islam. Rather, Allah makes you obliged for His having guided you to
the Faith, if you are truthful.</item>
        <item>Surely Allah knows the Unseen of the heavens and the
earth, and Allah keeps in sight whatever you do.”</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Qaf . ¹(I swear) by the glorious Qur’an, (you are sent
as a messenger.)</item>
        <item>But they wonder that a warner has come to them from
among themselves; so the disbelievers said, “This is something
strange.</item>
        <item>Is it when we die and become dust (that we will be
brought to life again?) That is a return, far (from
understanding).”</item>
        <item>We know very well how much of them is diminished by the
earth, and We have a Book that Preserves every thing. ²</item>
        <item>Rather, they rejected the truth when it came to them; so
they are in a confused state.</item>
        <item>Did they not, then, look to the sky above them, how We
have built it and beautified it, and it has no cracks?</item>
        <item>As for the earth, We have spread it out, and cast on it
firm hills, and caused to grow therein every kind of delightful
things,</item>
        <item>As a source of vision and as a lesson to every servant
(of Allah) who turns (to Him for guidance).</item>
        <item>And We sent down blessed water from the sky, and caused
to grow therewith gardens and grain of harvest,</item>
        <item>And towering date palms that have spadices, put one upon
another,</item>
        <item>As a provision to the servants (of Allah). And We gave
life with it to a dead land. Similar will be the exit (of the dead
from their graves).</item>
        <item>It (resurrection) was rejected before them by the people
of Nuh, and the people of Rass ³and Thamud,</item>
        <item>And ‘Ad, and Fir’aun (Pharaoh), and the brothers of Lut,
</item>
        <item>And dwellers of Aaikah, ⁴and the people of Tubba’. ⁵Each
one of them rejected the messengers; so My threat came true.</item>
        <item>Is it, then, that We were worn out by the first
creation? No, but they are still in confusion about the new creation.
</item>
        <item>Indeed We have created man, and We know whatever
thoughts his inner self develops, and We are closer to him than (his)
jugular vein,</item>
        <item>When the two receiving angels receive (every human act
to record it), seated (one) on the right and (one) on the left.
⁶</item>
        <item>Not a single word is uttered by one but there is a
watcher near him, ready (to record).</item>
        <item>The daze of death has (to) come with truth. That is what
you tried to escape.</item>
        <item>And the Horn will be blown. That will be the day of
(which) threat (was given).</item>
        <item>And everybody will come, along with one (angel) to drive
(him to the field of reckoning) and one (angel) to testify (about his
deeds).</item>
        <item>You were heedless of this. Now We have removed your veil
from you; so your sight today is sharp.”</item>
        <item>And his companion (i.e. the angel who recorded his
deeds) will say, “This is what I have with me, ready (to be presented
as his record of deeds).”</item>
        <item>Then it will be said,) “Cast, (O two angels,) into
Jahannam (Hell) every obstinate disbeliever</item>
        <item>Who used to prevent (others) from good (behavior), who
transgressed all bounds, who cast doubts (in true faith),</item>
        <item>Who set up another god along with Allah. So cast him (O
angels) in the painful punishment.”</item>
        <item>His (evil) companion (i.e. the Satan) will say, ⁷“O our
Lord, I did not cause him to rebel, but he was himself (involved) in
straying far from the track.”</item>
        <item>He (Allah) will say, “Do not quarrel before Me, while I
had sent to you My threat well in advance.</item>
        <item>The Word is not changed with Me, and I Am not so unjust
to My servants.”</item>
        <item>Remind them of) the Day when We will say to Jahannam
(Hell), “Are you filled up?” and it will say, “Are there some
more?”</item>
        <item>And the Jannah (Paradise) will be brought close for the
God-fearing, no longer distant.</item>
        <item>And it will be said,) “This is what you were promised
for everyone who was oft-returning to Allah, vigilant (against sins),
</item>
        <item>The one who feared the Rahman (The All-Merciful Allah),
without seeing Him, and came up with a heart oriented towards Him.
</item>
        <item>Enter it in peace. That is the Day of Eternity.”</item>
        <item>They will have in it whatever they wish, and with Us
there are things even more than that. ⁸</item>
        <item>And how many a generation We have destroyed before them
who were stronger than these in their grip on power, and they searched
out the cities. Was there any place (for them) to escape?</item>
        <item>Indeed, there is a lesson in all this for him who has a
heart and gives ear (to the truth) attentively.</item>
        <item>We created the heavens and the earth and all that is
between them in six days, and no weariness even touched Us.</item>
        <item>So, (O Prophet,) endure with patience what they say, and
proclaim His purity, along with your Lord’s praise, before sunrise and
before sunset.</item>
        <item>And in hours of night, proclaim His purity, and at the
ends of prostration.</item>
        <item>And listen: The Day when the caller will call out from a
near place,</item>
        <item>The Day they will hear the Cry in reality_ that will be
the Day of Resurrection.</item>
        <item>Surely We alone give life and bring death, and to Us is
the final return</item>
        <item>On the Day when the earth will burst apart exposing
them, while they will be hurrying up (to come out). That is an
assembly, so easy for Us (to muster).</item>
        <item>We know well what they say, and you are not (sent) as
one who compels them. So exhort, through the Qur’an, the one who fears
My warning.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>By those (winds) that scatter dust,</item>
        <item>Then those that bear load (of clouds),</item>
        <item>Then those that float with ease,</item>
        <item>Then those who distribute things, ¹</item>
        <item>Whatever you are being promised is surely true,</item>
        <item>And Recompense (of deeds) is sure to happen.</item>
        <item>By the sky, having paths,</item>
        <item>You are (involved) in a contradictory discussion.</item>
        <item>Turned away from this (Qur’an) is the one who is turned
away (totally from the truth.)</item>
        <item>Death upon those who make conjectures (against the true
faith),</item>
        <item>Those who are drowned in ignorance, forgetful!</item>
        <item>They ask, “When shall be the Day of Recompense?”</item>
        <item>It will be) the Day when they will be heated on the
Fire,</item>
        <item>And it will be said to them,) “Taste (the punishment of)
your mischief. This is what you have been asking to be brought
sooner.”</item>
        <item>The God-fearing (on the other hand) will be in gardens
and springs,</item>
        <item>Receiving what their Lord will have given to them.
Indeed, prior to this, they were good in their deeds.</item>
        <item>They used to sleep little in the night;</item>
        <item>And in the hours before dawn they used to pray for
forgiveness,</item>
        <item>And in their wealth, there was a right for one who asks
and for one who is deprived.</item>
        <item>In the earth, there are signs for those who (seek truth
to) believe,</item>
        <item>And in your own selves! So, do you not perceive?</item>
        <item>And in the heavens, there is your sustenance and all
that you have been promised.</item>
        <item>So, by the Lord of the heavens and the earth, it (the
Day of Recompense) is a reality, as sure as the fact that you (can)
speak.</item>
        <item>Has there come to you the story of the honoured guests
of Ibrahim? ²</item>
        <item>When they (the angels in human form) entered unto him
and said, “We greet you with Salam .” He said, “Salam on you.” (And he
said to himself,) “(They are) unknown people.”</item>
        <item>Then he slipped off to his home and fetched a fattened
calf.</item>
        <item>So he presented it before them (to eat, but being
angels, they refrained.) He said, “Would you not eat?”</item>
        <item>So he felt some fear in his heart. They said, “Be not
scared.” And they gave him the good news of (the birth of) a
knowledgeable boy.</item>
        <item>So his wife came forward with a clamor, and slapped her
own face and said, “(How can I have a child when I am) a barren old
woman?”</item>
        <item>They said, “This is how your Lord has said. Surely, He
is All-Wise, All-Knowing.”</item>
        <item>He (Ibrahim) said (to the angels), “Then, what is your
mission O messengers?”</item>
        <item>They said, “We are sent to a guilty people, (i.e. the
people of Sodom)</item>
        <item>So that we may send down upon them stones of clay,
</item>
        <item>Marked by your Lord for the transgressors.”</item>
        <item>So, We let the believers who were there to come out
(from danger),</item>
        <item>But We did not find in it any Muslims, except one house.
</item>
        <item>And We left in this (event) a sign (of deterrence) for
those who fear the painful punishment.</item>
        <item>And (We left a similar sign) in (the story of) Musa,
when We sent him to Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) with a clear proof.</item>
        <item>So he turned away along with his chiefs and said, “
(Musa is) a magician or a madman!”</item>
        <item>So We seized him and his army, and cast them into the
sea, as he was of culpable behaviour.</item>
        <item>And (a similar sign was left) in (the story of) ‘Ad,
when We sent upon them the wind that was barren (from any benefit);
</item>
        <item>It spared nothing it came upon, but rendered it like a
stuff smashed by decay.</item>
        <item>And (a similar sign was left) in (the story of) Thamud,
when it was said to them, “Enjoy yourselves for a while.”</item>
        <item>Then they rebelled against the command of your Lord; so
the thunderbolt (of divine punishment) seized them, while they were
looking on.</item>
        <item>Then they were neither able to stand (before the
punishment), nor could they defend themselves.</item>
        <item>And (We have destroyed) the people of Nuh even before;
indeed they were a sinful people. ³</item>
        <item>And the sky was built by Us with might; and indeed We
are the expanders. ⁴</item>
        <item>And the earth was spread out by Us as a floor; so how
well have We spread it out!</item>
        <item>And from every thing We have created pairs of twos, so
that you may heed.</item>
        <item>So, flee to Allah. ⁵Indeed I am a plain warner sent by
Him for you.</item>
        <item>And do not make up any other god along with Allah.
Indeed I am a plain warner sent by Him for you.</item>
        <item>In similar way, no messenger came to those before them,
but they said, “(He is) a magician or a madman.”</item>
        <item>Have they handed down this (saying) to each other as a
legacy? Rather they are a rebellious people.</item>
        <item>So, turn away from them, for you are not blamed.</item>
        <item>And keep reminding, because reminding benefits the
believers.</item>
        <item>I did not create the Jinns and the human beings except
for the purpose that they should worship Me.</item>
        <item>I do not want any sustenance from them, nor do I want
them to feed Me.</item>
        <item>In fact, Allah is the All-Sustainer, Possessor of power,
the Strong.</item>
        <item>So, those who did wrong will have their turn like the
turn of their counterparts. ⁶So, they should not ask Me to hasten on.
</item>
        <item>Woe, then, to those who disbelieve because of the Day of
theirs that they are promised (for punishment).</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>By the mount of Tur, ¹</item>
        <item>And by a book, written</item>
        <item>On an unrolled scroll, ²</item>
        <item>And by the Populated House (Al-Bait-ul-Ma‘mur) ,
³</item>
        <item>And by the roof, raised high,</item>
        <item>And by the sea, flared up (with fire), ⁴</item>
        <item>The punishment of your Lord is sure to fall.</item>
        <item>There is nothing to push it back,</item>
        <item>The Day when the sky will tremble, a horrible trembling,
</item>
        <item>And the mountains will move about, a terrible movement.
</item>
        <item>So, woe to those who reject (the true faith),</item>
        <item>Who are indulged in vain talk, playing (with truth),
</item>
        <item>The Day they will be pushed to the Fire forcefully,
</item>
        <item>And it will be said to them,) “This is the Fire you used
to deny.</item>
        <item>Is it then magic, or do you not see?</item>
        <item>Enter it. Now, whether you endure (it) patiently or
impatiently, it is all the same for you; you are merely rewarded for
what you used to do.”</item>
        <item>Of course, the God-fearing will be in gardens and bliss,
</item>
        <item>Enjoying what their Lord will have given to them, and
their Lord will have saved them from the punishment of Hell.</item>
        <item>It will be said to them,) “Eat and drink pleasantly
because of what you used to do,</item>
        <item>Relaxing on lined up couches”. And We will marry them
with big-eyed houris.</item>
        <item>And those who believed and their children followed them
in belief, We will join their children with them, and will not curtail
(the reward of) any of their deeds at all. ⁵Every person will be
pledged for what he earned.</item>
        <item>And We will go on giving them whatever they desire of
fruits and meat.</item>
        <item>They will snatch from one another (in a friendly manner)
a glass (of wine) carrying neither absurd talk, nor something leading
to sin.</item>
        <item>And their own serving boys will rotate around them, (who
will be as neat and clean) as if they were hidden pearls.</item>
        <item>And they will advance to one another, asking (about each
other’s welfare).</item>
        <item>They will say, “Indeed we were afraid (of Allah’s
punishment) when we were amidst our family,</item>
        <item>But Allah did favour to us and saved us from the torment
of Fire’s scorching breath.</item>
        <item>We used to pray to Him before. He is surely the MostKind, the Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>So keep reminding (them), because by the grace of your
Lord, you are neither a soothsayer, nor a mad man.</item>
        <item>Do they rather say, “He is a poet for whom we are
awaiting the accident of death?” ⁶</item>
        <item>Say, “Wait! I am waiting with you, too.”</item>
        <item>Is it their intellects that direct them to (say) this,
or are they a rebellious people?</item>
        <item>Do they rather say, “He has forged it (the Qur’an.)”?
No, but they do not believe.</item>
        <item>So, let them bring a discourse like this, if they are
truthful. ⁷</item>
        <item>Is it that they are created by none, or are they
themselves the creators?</item>
        <item>Or have they created the heavens and the earth? No, but
they are sure of nothing.</item>
        <item>Or do they have the treasures of your Lord, or have they
acquired control (over them)? ⁸</item>
        <item>Or have they a stairway (to the heavens) by means of
which they listen (to the divine decrees)? If so, their listener must
bring a clear proof. ⁹</item>
        <item>Is it that He has daughters and you have sons?</item>
        <item>Or is it that you (O prophet) ask them for a fee, and
therefore they are burdened with a liability?</item>
        <item>Or have they the knowledge of the Unseen, and they are
recording it?</item>
        <item>Or do they intend to plan to do harm (to the prophet)?
Then the disbelievers themselves shall be harmed by the plan.</item>
        <item>Or do they have a god other than Allah? Pure is Allah
from what they associate with Him.</item>
        <item>Even if they see a piece falling down from the sky, they
would say, “It is a cumulated cloud.”</item>
        <item>¹⁰So, leave them alone until they face their Day, in
which they will be turned unconscious,</item>
        <item>The Day their planning will not benefit them in the
least, nor will they be helped.</item>
        <item>And for those who did wrong there is another punishment
before that, ¹¹but most of them do not know.</item>
        <item>And (O Prophet) be patient about the decision of your
Lord, because you are in front of Our Eyes. And proclaim the purity of
your Lord along with His praise when you stand (in Prayer),</item>
        <item>And, in parts of night too, proclaim His purity, and at
the time of setting of the stars.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>By the star when it goes down to set, ¹</item>
        <item>Your fellow (the Holy Prophet (S.A.W)) ²has neither
missed the way, nor did he deviate.</item>
        <item>He does not speak out of (his own) desire.</item>
        <item>It is but revelation revealed (to him).</item>
        <item>It is taught to him by one (angel) of strong faculties,
</item>
        <item>The one of vigour. So he stood poised,</item>
        <item>While he was on the upper horizon. ³</item>
        <item>Then he drew near, and came down,</item>
        <item>So as he was at a distance like that of two bows (joined
together), ⁴rather even nearer.</item>
        <item>Thus He (Allah) revealed to His slave what He revealed.
</item>
        <item>The heart did not err in what he saw.</item>
        <item>Do you quarrel with him in what he sees?</item>
        <item>Indeed he saw him another time</item>
        <item>By Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (the lote-tree in the upper realm),
</item>
        <item>Near which there is Jannat-ul-Ma’wa (the Paradise of
Abode), ⁵</item>
        <item>When the lote-tree was covered by that which covered it.
⁶</item>
        <item>The eye neither went wrong, nor did exceed the limit.
</item>
        <item>He has indeed seen a part of the biggest signs of your
Lord.</item>
        <item>Have you ever considered about the (idols of) Lat and
‘Uzza,</item>
        <item>And about the other, the third (idol), namely, Manat,?
⁷</item>
        <item>Is it that you have males and He (Allah) has females?
</item>
        <item>If so, it is a bizarre division. ⁸</item>
        <item>These are nothing but names you and your fathers have
invented; Allah has sent down no authority attached to them. They are
following nothing but conjecture and what their own souls desire,
while guidance from their Lord has surely reached them.</item>
        <item>Is it that man can get whatever he wishes? ⁹</item>
        <item>No,) because to Allah alone belongs the (good of) the
Hereafter and the former life (of this world).</item>
        <item>How many angels there are in the heavens whose
intercession cannot benefit (any one) at all, but after Allah allows
(it) for whomsoever He wills and pleases.</item>
        <item>Those who do not believe in the Hereafter call the
angels by names of females.</item>
        <item>They do not have knowledge about it. They follow nothing
but conjecture, and conjecture is of no avail in (the matter of)
Truth.</item>
        <item>So, turn away from him who turns away from Our advice,
and seeks nothing but (pleasure of) the worldly life.</item>
        <item>That is the limit of their access to knowledge. Indeed
only your Lord knows well about the one who has gone astray from his
way, and He knows well about the one who has adopted the right path.
</item>
        <item>To Allah belongs whatever there is in the heavens and
whatever there is in the earth, so that He gives punishment to
evildoers for what they did, and gives good reward to those who did
good</item>
        <item>Those who abstain from the major sins and from shameful
acts, except minor involvements. ¹⁰Indeed your Lord is extensive in
forgiveness. He knows you more than anyone else (from a time) when He
created you from the earth and when you were embryos in the wombs of
your mothers. So, do not claim purity (from faults) for your selves.
He knows best who is God-fearing.</item>
        <item>Did you see the one who turned away,</item>
        <item>And gave a little, and stopped? ¹¹</item>
        <item>Does he have knowledge of the Unseen whereby he sees
(what he believes)?</item>
        <item>Has he not been told of what was (revealed) in the
scriptures of Musa</item>
        <item>And of Ibrahim who fulfilled (his duties)?</item>
        <item>It was) that no bearer of burden shall bear the burden
of the other,</item>
        <item>And that a man shall not deserve but (the reward of) his
own effort,</item>
        <item>And that his effort will soon be seen,</item>
        <item>Then he will be recompensed for it in full,</item>
        <item>And that to your Lord is the end (of every one),</item>
        <item>And that He is the One who makes (one) laugh and makes
(him) weep,</item>
        <item>And that He is the One who gives death and gives life,
</item>
        <item>And that He creates the pairs, male and female,</item>
        <item>From a sperm-drop when it is poured (into a womb),
</item>
        <item>And that the second creation is undertaken by Him,
</item>
        <item>And that He is the One who gives wealth and preserves
(it),</item>
        <item>And that He is the One who is the Lord of Sirius (the
star worshipped by pagans),</item>
        <item>And that He has destroyed the earlier ‘Ad,</item>
        <item>And Thamud, so spared none,</item>
        <item>And (destroyed) the people of Nuh even earlier. Surely
they were more unjust and more rebellious.</item>
        <item>And He destroyed the overturned towns (of the people of
Lut) also,</item>
        <item>So enveloped they were by that which enveloped.
¹²</item>
        <item>Then concerning which of your Lord’s bounties would you
remain in doubt?</item>
        <item>This (Prophet) is a warner from the (genus of the)
previous warners.</item>
        <item>The Imminent (Hour of Judgment) has approached.</item>
        <item>There is no one, beside Allah, to remove it.</item>
        <item>Do you then wonder at this discourse,</item>
        <item>And laugh (at it), and not weep,</item>
        <item>While you are engaged in vain play?</item>
        <item>Now, fall down in prostration and worship (Allah).
¹³</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>The Hour (of doom) has drawn near, and the moon has
split asunder.¹</item>
        <item>When these people see a sign, they turn away and say,
“(This is) a transient magic.”</item>
        <item>They have rejected (the Truth) and followed their
desires, while every matter has to settle (at some time).</item>
        <item>And there has come to them as much news (of the earlier
communities) as it is enough to deter,</item>
        <item>Containing) a perfect wisdom. But the warnings are of no
avail (to them).</item>
        <item>Therefore, turn aside (O Prophet,) from them. (They will
see the reality) on the day in which the caller will call (them) to a
gruesome object.</item>
        <item>With their eyes humbled, they will come out of the
graves like locusts spread all over,</item>
        <item>Rushing quickly towards the caller. (On that Day) the
disbelievers will say, “This is a hard day.”</item>
        <item>The people of Nuh denied (the truth) before them. So
they rejected Our servant, and said, “(He is) a madman”, and he was
(also) threatened (by them).</item>
        <item>So he prayed to his Lord saying, “I am overpowered, so
defend (me).”</item>
        <item>So We opened the gates of the sky with water pouring
forth profusely,</item>
        <item>And We caused the earth to gush forth as springs; so the
water (of both kinds) met together for a destined event.</item>
        <item>And We caused him (Nuh) to board that (ship) which had
planks and nails,</item>
        <item>Which sailed under Our Eyes, as a reward for the one who
was rejected (by the infidels).</item>
        <item>And We left it (the ship) as a sign. So, is there one to
take lesson?</item>
        <item>Then how was My torment and My warnings?</item>
        <item>Indeed We have made the Qur’an easy for seeking advice.
So, is there one to heed to the advice?</item>
        <item>The people of) ‘Ad rejected (their prophet). So how was
My torment and My warnings?</item>
        <item>We did send to them a furious wind in a day of
continuous misfortune, ²</item>
        <item>Plucking people away, as if they were trunks of uprooted
palm-trees.</item>
        <item>So how was My torment and My warnings?</item>
        <item>Indeed We have made the Qur’an easy for seeking advice.
So, is there one to heed to the advice?</item>
        <item>The people of) Thamud rejected the warners.</item>
        <item>So they said, “Shall we follow a single human being from
among us? Then we will be in error and insanity.</item>
        <item>Is it that the advice has been cast upon him alone out
of all of us? No, but he is a bragging liar.”</item>
        <item>Tomorrow they will know who the bragging liar is!</item>
        <item>We are going to send the she-camel as a trial for them;
so watch them (O Salih,) and keep patience,</item>
        <item>And tell them that water (of the well) is to be shared
between them (and the she-camel), so as the right of having water
shall be attended by each (alternatively).</item>
        <item>Then they called their man (to kill the she-camel,) so
he undertook (the task) and killed (the she-camel).</item>
        <item>So how was My torment and My warnings?</item>
        <item>We sent upon them a single Cry, and they were like
crushed leafs of a hedge-builder.</item>
        <item>Indeed We have made the Qur’an easy for seeking advice.
So, is there one to heed to the advice?</item>
        <item>The people of Lut rejected the warners.</item>
        <item>We sent upon them a rain of stones, except the family of
Lut whom We saved in the last hours of night,</item>
        <item>As a grace from Us. This is how We reward the one who
offers gratitude.</item>
        <item>And he (Lut) had certainly warned them of Our grasp, but
they disputed the warnings.</item>
        <item>And they had even tried to tempt him against his guests
(so that they may snatch them away for bad purpose,) but We blinded
their eyes: ³“Now taste My torment and My warnings!”</item>
        <item>And on the next morning, a lasting torment overtook
them:</item>
        <item>Now taste My torment and My warnings.”</item>
        <item>Indeed We have made the Qur’an easy for seeking advice.
So, is there one to heed to the advice?</item>
        <item>And the warners came to the family of Fir‘aun (Pharaoh).
</item>
        <item>But) they rejected all Our signs; so We seized them_ a
seizure by One Mighty, Powerful.</item>
        <item>Are the disbelievers among you in a better position than
all of the aforesaid (punished people), or do you have immunity
(recorded) in the sacred books?</item>
        <item>Or do they say, “We are a large group, well-defended.”?
</item>
        <item>Soon this ‘large group’ shall be defeated, and all of
them will turn their backs. ⁴</item>
        <item>Rather the Hour (of judgment) is their appointed time
(for their full recompense), and the Hour is more calamitous and much
more bitter.</item>
        <item>Surely the guilty ones are in error and madness.</item>
        <item>On the Day when they will be dragged into the Fire on
their faces, (it will be said to them,) “Taste the touch of
Hell.”</item>
        <item>Verily, We have created every thing according to (Our)
predestination.</item>
        <item>And (implementation of) Our command is no more than a
single act like the twinkling of an eye.</item>
        <item>We have destroyed people like you; so, is there one to
take lesson?</item>
        <item>And every thing they have done is recorded in the books
(of deeds).</item>
        <item>And every thing, small and big, is written down.</item>
        <item>Of course, the God-fearing will be in gardens and
rivers,</item>
        <item>In a seat of Truth, near to the Omnipotent Sovereign.
</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>The Rahman (The All-Merciful Allah)</item>
        <item>Has taught the Qur’an.</item>
        <item>He has created man.</item>
        <item>He has taught him (how) to express himself.</item>
        <item>The sun and the moon are (bound) by a (fixed)
calculation.</item>
        <item>And the vine and the tree both prostrate (to Allah).
¹</item>
        <item>He raised the sky high, and has placed the scale,</item>
        <item>So that you should not be wrongful in weighing. ²</item>
        <item>Observe the correct weight with fairness, and do not
make weighing deficient.</item>
        <item>As for the earth, He has placed it for creatures,</item>
        <item>In which there are fruits and date palms having sheaths,
</item>
        <item>And the grain having chaff, and fragrant flowers.</item>
        <item>So, (O mankind and Jinn,) which of the bounties of your
Lord will you deny?</item>
        <item>He has created man from dry clay, ringing like pottery,
</item>
        <item>And created Jann (father of the Jinn) from a smokeless
flame of fire.</item>
        <item>So, (O mankind and Jinn,) which of the bounties of your
Lord will you deny?</item>
        <item>He is the Lord of both points of sunrise and both points
of sunset. ³</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>He let forth the two seas to meet together,</item>
        <item>While there is a barrier between them; they do not
encroach (upon one another).</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>From both of them come forth the pearl and the coral.
</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>And His are the sailing ships raised up in the sea like
mountains.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>Every one who is on it (the earth) has to perish.</item>
        <item>And your Lord’s Countenance will remain, full of
majesty, full of honour.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>All those in the heavens and the earth beseech Him (for
their needs.) Every day He is in a state of action.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>Soon We are going to spare Ourselves for you (to reckon
your deeds), O two heavy species (of Jinn and mankind)!</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>O genera of Jinn and mankind, If you are able to
penetrate beyond the realms of the heavens and the earth, then
penetrate. You cannot penetrate without power. ⁴</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>A flame of fire and a smoke will be loosed against you,
and you will not (be able) to defend.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>So, (it will be a terrible event) when the sky will be
split apart and will become rosy, like (red) hides.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>On that day, neither a man will be questioned about his
sin, nor a Jinn. ⁵</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>The guilty ones will be recognized (by angels) through
their marks and will be seized by foreheads and feet.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>This is Jahannam (Hell) that the guilty people deny.
</item>
        <item>They will circle around between it and between hot,
boiling water.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
⁶</item>
        <item>And for the one who is fearful of having to stand before
his Lord, there are two gardens, __</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>Both having branches.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>In both there are two flowing springs.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>In both there are two kinds of every fruit.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>The people of these gardens will be) reclining on
floorings whose (even) linings will be of thick silk, and the fruits
plucked from the two gardens will be at hand.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>In them there will be maidens restraining (their)
glances, ⁷whom neither a man might have touched before them, nor a
Jinn.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>They will look like rubies and corals.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>Is there any reward for goodness other than goodness?
</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>And besides these two, there are two other gardens (for
the second category of the God-fearing),__</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>Both (gardens are) dark green!</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>In both there are two springs gushing forth profusely.
</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>In both there are fruits and date-palms and
pomegranates.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?

        <item>In them there will be women, good and gorgeous,__</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>The houris, kept guarded in pavilions__</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>Whom neither a man might have touched before them, nor a
Jinn.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>The people of these gardens will be) reclining on green
cushions and marvelously beautiful mattresses.</item>
        <item>So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
</item>
        <item>Glorious is the name of your Lord, the Lord of Majesty,
the Lord of Honour.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>When the Imminent Event (of Doom) will occur,</item>
        <item>There will be no one to deny its occurrence.</item>
        <item>It will be abasing (some), exalting (others)</item>
        <item>When the earth will be jolted with a terrible jolt,
</item>
        <item>And the mountains will be crumbled a thorough crumbling,
</item>
        <item>Until they will become dust, scattered in the air,

        <item>And you will be (divided into) three categories.

        <item>Those are the ones blessed with nearness (to Allah)
</item>
        <item>In gardens of bliss,</item>
        <item>Many from the first generations,</item>
        <item>And a few from the later ones. ²</item>
        <item>They will be sitting) on thrones woven with gold,</item>
        <item>Reclining on them, facing each other.</item>
        <item>Immortal boys will rotate around them</item>
        <item>With bowls and jugs and a goblet of pure wine,</item>

eyes,</item>
        <item>All (neat and clean) like a hidden pearl,</item>

greetings).</item>
        <item>And the People of the right? How (lucky) are the People
of the Right!</item>
        <item>They will be) amid lote-trees with no thorns,</item>
        <item>And the trees of talh , (banana, or a fragrant tree)
having layers one upon the other,</item>

People of the Left!</item>
        <item>They will be) in scorching wind and boiling water,
</item>
        <item>And in a shade of black smoke,</item>
        <item>Neither cool nor graceful.</item>
        <item>They were earlier in luxuries,</item>
        <item>And used to persist in major sins,</item>
        <item>And used to say, “Is it that when we die and become
dust__is it that we will be raised again,</item>

specified Day.</item>
        <item>Then O you, the erring, the denying people,</item>
        <item>You will have to eat from the tree of zaqqum, ³</item>
        <item>And to fill with it the bellies,</item>
        <item>Then on top of it you will have to drink boiling water,
</item>
        <item>And to drink like camels suffering from the disease of
over-thirst.</item>
        <item>This will be their welcome entertainment on the Day of
Requital.</item>
        <item>We have created you; then why do you not believe in it?
</item>
        <item>So, tell Me about the semen you drop (in the wombs):
</item>
        <item>Is it you who create it, or are We the Creator?</item>
        <item>We have appointed (the times of) death among you, and We
cannot be frustrated</item>
        <item>From replacing you with others like you, and creating
you (afresh) in that (form) which you do not know.</item>
        <item>And you certainly know the first creation; ⁴then why do
you not take lesson?</item>
        <item>Well, tell Me about that (seed) which you sow:</item>
        <item>Is it you who grow it, or are We the One who grows?
</item>
        <item>If We so will, We can certainly make it crumbled, and
you will remain wondering,</item>
        <item>And saying,) “We are laden with debt,</item>
        <item>Rather we are totally deprived.”</item>
        <item>Again, tell Me about the water you drink:</item>
        <item>Is it you who have brought it down from the clouds, or
are We the One who sends (it) down?</item>
        <item>If We so will, We can make it bitter in taste. So why do
you not offer gratitude?</item>
        <item>Now tell Me about the fire you kindle:</item>
        <item>Is it you who have originated its tree, ⁵or are We the
Originator?</item>
        <item>We have made it a reminder (of Our infinite power, and
of the fire of Hell) and a benefit for travelers in deserts.</item>
        <item>So, proclaim purity of the name of your Lord, the
Magnificent.</item>
        <item>So, I swear by the setting places of the stars,</item>
        <item>And indeed it is a great oath, if you are to
appreciate__</item>
        <item>It is surely the Noble Qur’an,</item>
        <item>Recorded already) in a protected book (i.e. the
Preserved Tablet)</item>
        <item>That is not touched except by the purified ones (the
angels).</item>
        <item>A revelation from the Lord of the worlds.</item>
        <item>Is it this discourse that you take lightly,</item>
        <item>And take your denial as your livelihood? ⁶</item>
        <item>So why (do you) not (intervene) when the soul (of a
dying person) reaches the throat,</item>
        <item>And you are watching?</item>
        <item>And We are closer to him than you, but you do not
perceive.</item>
        <item>So, if you are not going to be recompensed (in the
Hereafter for your deeds), then why do you not</item>
        <item>Bring the soul back, if you are truthful? ⁷</item>
        <item>So, in case he (the dying person) is from among those
blessed with nearness,</item>
        <item>Then (for him) there is comfort and fragrance and garden
of bliss.</item>
        <item>And in case he is from among the People of the Right,
</item>
        <item>Then, (it will be said to him,) “Peace is for you, as
you are one of the People of the Right.”</item>
        <item>But if he is one of the deniers, the astray,</item>
        <item>Then (for him) there is entertainment from boiling
water,</item>
        <item>And burning in the Hell.</item>
        <item>Indeed this is certainty in its true sense.</item>
        <item>So, proclaim purity of the name of your Lord, the
Magnificent.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>All that is in the heavens and the earth proclaims
Allah’s purity, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.</item>
        <item>To Him belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth.
He gives life and brings death, and He is Powerful to do any thing.
</item>
        <item>He is the First and the Last, and the Manifest and the
Hidden, ¹and He is All-Knowing about every thing.</item>
        <item>He is the One who created the heavens and the earth in
six days, then He positioned Himself on the Throne. He knows whatever
goes into the earth and whatever comes out from it, and whatever
descends from the sky, and whatever ascends thereto. He is with you
wherever you are, and Allah is watchful of whatever you do.</item>
        <item>To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth,
and to Allah all matters are returned.</item>
        <item>He makes the night enter into the day, and makes the day
enter into the night, and He is All-Knowing about whatever lies in the
hearts.</item>
        <item>Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and spend out of
that (wealth) in which He has appointed you as deputies. ²So, for
those of you who have believed and spent (in Allah’s way), there is a
big reward.</item>
        <item>What is wrong with you that you do not believe in Allah,
while the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord, and He has
taken your covenant, if you are to believe?</item>
        <item>He is the One who reveals clear verses to His servant,
so that He brings you out from layers of darkness into the light. And
to you, Allah is Very-Kind indeed, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>And what is wrong with you that you should not spend in
the way of Allah, while to Allah belongs the inheritance of the
heavens and the earth? Those who spent before the Conquest (of Makkah)
and fought are not at par (with others). Those are much greater in
rank than those who spent later and fought, though Allah has promised
the good (reward) for each. ³Allah is well aware of what you do.
</item>
        <item>Who is there to advance a loan, a good loan, to Allah ⁴so
that He multiplies it for him, and he may have a noble reward?</item>
        <item>On the Day when you will see the believing men and the
believing women, their light proceeding in front of them and to their
right hands, (it will be said to them,) “Good news for you today!
Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever! That is
the great achievement,</item>
        <item>The Day when the hypocrite men and hypocrite women will
say to those who believe, “Wait for us, so that we may have a share
from your light.” ⁵It will be said (to them), “Go back to your rear,
and search for light.” Then a wall will be placed between them, which
will have a gate. In its inner side, there will be the divine mercy,
while towards its outer side, there will be the divine punishment.
</item>
        <item>They (the hypocrites) will call out to them (the
believers), “Were we not with you?” They will say, “Yes, (you were,)
but you led your souls to a wrong way, and kept waiting (for an evil
end to the Muslims), and remained in doubt, and were deluded by
fancies, until Allah’s command came to pass, and you were deceived
about Allah by the Big Deceiver (Iblis).</item>
        <item>So, no ransom will be accepted from you today, nor from
those who disbelieved (openly). Your abode is the Fire, and it is an
evil end.”</item>
        <item>Has the time not yet come for those who believe that
their hearts should be humble for the remembrance of Allah and for the
truth that has descended (through revelation)? They must not be like
those to whom the Book was given before, but a long period passed on
them (in which they did not repent), therefore their hearts became
hard, and (thus) many of them are sinners. ⁶</item>
        <item>Know well that Allah revives the land after its death.
We have made the signs clear for you, so that you may understand.
⁷</item>
        <item>Surely those men who give sadaqah (alms) and those women
who give sadaqah and have advanced a good loan to Allah, for them it
will be multiplied, and for them there is a noble reward.</item>
        <item>And those who believed in Allah and His messengers, -
those are the Siddiqs (the most righteous after prophets (A.S)) and
the Shuhada’ (martyrs) in the sight of your Lord. For them shall be
their reward and their light. As for those who disbelieved and
rejected Our verses, they are the inmates of Hell.</item>
        <item>Know well that the worldly life is but a play and an
amusement, and a show of beauty, and exchange of boastful claims
between you, and a competition of increase in riches and children. ⁸
(All this is) like a rain, the growth of which attracts the farmers,
then it withers, and you see it turning yellow,then it becomes straw.
And in the Hereafter there is a severe punishment (for the
disbelievers), and forgiveness from Allah and (Allah’s) pleasure (for
the believers and the righte</item>
        <item>Compete each other in proceeding towards forgiveness
from your Lord and to Paradise the width of which is like the width of
the sky and the earth. It has been prepared for those who believe in
Allah and His messengers. That is the bounty of Allah; He gives it to
whomsoever He Wills and Allah is the Lord of the great bounty.</item>
        <item>No calamity befalls the earth or your own selves, but it
is (pre-destined) in a Book before We bring it into being, __Indeed it
is easy for Allah.</item>
        <item>So that you may neither grieve on what has escaped you,
nor over-exult on what He has given to you. ⁹And Allah does not love
any self-admirer, over-proud,</item>
        <item>Those who are miserly and bid others to be miserly. And
whoever turns away, then Allah is the All-Independent, the EverPraised.</item>
        <item>We have indeed sent Our messengers with clear proofs,
and sent down with them the Book and the Balance, so that people may
uphold equity. And We sent down iron in which there is strong power,
and benefits for the people; ¹⁰and (We did it) so that Allah knows the
one who helps Him and His messengers without seeing (Him). Surely
Allah is Strong, Mighty.</item>
        <item>Indeed We sent Nuh and Ibrahim, and kept the Book and
prophet-hood (continuing) in their progeny. So, some of those (to whom
they were sent) were on the right path, and many of them were sinners.
</item>
        <item>Then We made Our messengers follow them one after the
other, then We sent after them ‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, son of
Mary), and gave him the Injil, and placed compassion and mercy in the
hearts of his followers. As for monasticism, it was invented by them;
We did not ordain it for them, but (they adopted it) to seek Allah’s
pleasure, then could not observe it as was due. ¹¹So We gave the
believers from among them their reward. And many of them are sinners.
</item>
        <item>O you who believe, fear Allah, and believe in His
Messenger, and He will give you two shares (of reward) out of His
mercy, and will make for you a light whereby you will walk, and will
forgive you,__ And Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>So that the People of the Book may know that they have
no control over any thing from Allah’s bounty, and that bounty is in
Allah’s hand; He gives it to whom He wills, ¹²and Allah is the Lord of
the great bounty.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Allah has heard the talk of the woman who was debating
with you about her husband, and was complaining to Allah. Allah was
hearing the conversation between both of you. Indeed, Allah is AllHearing, All-Knowing.</item>
        <item>Those of you who declare zihar ¹against their wives,
they are not their mothers. Their mothers are none else but those who
gave birth to them. Undoubtedly they utter an evil word and a lie; and
Allah is surely Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Those who declare zihar against their wives, then
retract what they said, obligated on them is to free the neck (of a
slave) before the two (spouses) touch one another. This is what you
are advised, and Allah is well aware of what you do.</item>
        <item>But whoever does not find (a slave) has to fast for two
consecutive months before the two (spouses) touch one another. Then
the one who is not able to do so has to feed sixty indigent persons.
²This is (laid down) so that you believe in Allah and His Messenger.
These are the limits set by Allah; and for the disbelievers there is a
painful punishment.</item>
        <item>Surely those who oppose Allah and His Messenger shall be
disgraced, just as those before them were disgraced. We have sent down
clear verses, and for the disbelievers there is a humiliating
punishment</item>
        <item>On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together,
and will tell them what they did; Allah has its full account, while
they have forgotten it. Allah is witness to every thing.</item>
        <item>Have you not observed that Allah knows everything in the
heavens and everything in the earth? No secret consulta-tion takes
place between three, but He is fourth of them, nor between five, but
He is sixth of them, nor between fewer than that or more, but He is
with them wherever they may be. Then He will tell them on the Day of
Judgment what they did. Surely Allah is All-Knowing about every thing.
</item>
        <item>Did you not see those who were forbidden from holding
secret talks; then they do again what they were forbidden to do? ³They
whisper for sinful act and wrongdoing and disobedience of the prophet,
and when they come to you, they greet you the way Allah does not greet
you, and say to themselves, “Why does Allah not punish us for what we
say?” ⁴Enough for them is Jahannam (Hell); they will enter it, and it
is an evil end.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, when you hold secret counsel, do not
whisper for sinful act and wrongdoing and disobedience of the prophet,
and do whisper for righteousness and taqwa (piety). And fear Allah,
before whom you will be gathered together.</item>
        <item>Whispering (for sinful acts) comes from the Shaitan
(Satan), so that he may grieve those who believe, while it is not
harmful to them in the least, except with Allah’s permission. And in
Allah the believers must place their trust. ⁵</item>
        <item>O you who believe, when it is said to you, “Make room
(for others) in the sittings”, then make room, and Allah will make
room for you (in the Hereafter). And when it is said, “Rise up”, then
rise up, ⁶and Allah will raise those, in ranks, who have believed and
are given knowledge. Allah is well-aware of what you do.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, when you consult the Messenger in
private, then offer something in charity before your consultation.
⁷That is better for you and purer. But if you find nothing (to offer),
then Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Have you become afraid of offering charities before your
consultation? So when you did not do so, and Allah has forgiven you,
then establish Salah, and pay Zakah, and obey Allah and His Messenger.
⁸And Allah is well aware of what you do.</item>
        <item>Have you not seen those who have friendship with a
people with whom Allah is angry. They are neither of you nor of them.
⁹They swear false oaths while they know.</item>
        <item>Allah has prepared a severe punishment for them. Indeed,
evil is what they have been doing.</item>
        <item>They have taken their oaths as a shield, ¹⁰and then have
prevented (people) from the way of Allah. Therefore, for them there is
a humiliating punishment.</item>
        <item>Their riches and their children will never benefit them
against Allah. They are the inmates of the Fire. They will live there
forever,</item>
        <item>The Day Allah will raise all of them, and they will
swear before Him as they swear before you, and will think that they
have something to stand upon. Be assured that they are sheer liars.
</item>
        <item>The Shaitan (Satan) has prevailed upon them; so he has
made them neglect to remember Allah. They are the party of Shaitan .
Be assured that it is (the members of the) party of Shaitan that are
the losers.</item>
        <item>Indeed, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, they
are among the lowest.</item>
        <item>Allah has written (in His pre-destined decree), “I will
certainly prevail, both I and My messengers.” Surely Allah is AllStrong, All-Mighty.</item>
        <item>You will not find those who believe in Allah and in the
Hereafter having friendship with those who oppose Allah and His
Messenger, even though they may be their fathers or their sons or
their brothers or their clan. They are such that Allah has inscribed
faith on their hearts, and has supported them with a spirit from Him.
He will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, in which they
will live forever. Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased
with Allah. Those are the party of Allah. Be assured that it is (the
members of) the party of Allah that are the successful.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Allah’s purity has been proclaimed by all that is in the
heavens and all that is in the earth. And He is the All-Mighty, the
All-Wise.</item>
        <item>He is the One who expelled the disbelievers of the
People of the Book from their homes at the time of the first
gathering. ¹You did not expect that they would leave, and they deemed
that their fortresses would protect them from Allah. But Allah came to
them from where they did not expect, and cast fear in their hearts
when they were spoiling their homes with their own hands and with the
hands of the believers. ²So, learn a lesson, O you who have eyes to
see.</item>
        <item>If Allah had not destined exile for them, He would have
punished them in the world. And for them in the Hereafter is the
torment of the Fire.</item>
        <item>That is because they were hostile to Allah and His
Messenger. And whoever has hostility with Allah (must know that) Allah
is severe in punishment.</item>
        <item>Whatever palm-trees you have cut down, or have left them
standing on their roots, it was with Allah’s permission, and so that
He might disgrace the transgressors. ³</item>
        <item>And whatever fai’ ⁴(left over property) Allah has passed
on to His Messenger from them, you had not urged on your horses or
camels for it, but Allah gives predominance to His messengers over
whomsoever He wills, and Allah is Powerful over every thing.</item>
        <item>Whatever fai’ Allah has passed on to His Messenger from
the people of the towns is for Allah and for the Messenger, and for
the kinsmen and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, so that it
may not circulate only between the rich among you. And whatever the
Messenger gives you, take it, and whatever he forbids you from,
abstain (from it). And fear Allah. Indeed Allah is severe in
punishment.</item>
        <item>And fai’ is especially) for the poor emigrants who were
expelled from their homes and properties, while they were seeking
Allah’s grace and pleasure, and were helping (the religion of) Allah
and His Messenger. They are the truthful.</item>
        <item>And (fai’ is also) for those who established themselves
in the homeland (of Madinah) and in faith before the former ones
(arrived in Madinah), who have love for those who emigrated to them,
and do not feel in their hearts any ambition for what is given to the
former ones (from fai’), and give preference (to them) over
themselves, even though they are in poverty. ⁵__And those who are saved
from the greed of their hearts are the successful.__</item>
        <item>And (fai’ is also) for those who came after them saying,
“Our Lord, forgive us and those of our brothers who preceded us in
faith, and do not place in our hearts any rancor against those who
believe; ⁶Surely, Our Lord, you are Very-Kind, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Did you not see the hypocrites saying to their brothers
from those of the people of the Book who are unbelievers, “If you are
expelled, we will certainly go out with you, and we will never obey
anyone about you. And if you are fought against, we will definitely
help you.” Allah bears witness that they are pure liars.</item>
        <item>If they are expelled, they will not go out with them,
and if they are fought against, they will not help them. And even if
they help them, they will surely turn their backs, then they will not
be helped.</item>
        <item>In fact, your fear in their hearts is greater than (that
of) Allah. That is because they are a people who do not understand.
</item>
        <item>They do not fight you, even assembled together, but in
fortified towns, or from behind the walls. Their quarrelling between
themselves is severe. You think that they are united, while their
hearts are divided. That is because they are a people who have no
sense.</item>
        <item>The example (of Banu Nadir) is like those who were
before them in near past, ⁷who tasted the evil consequence of their
conduct, and for them (in the Hereafter) there is a painful
punishment.</item>
        <item>The example (of the hypocrites) is like the Shaitan when
he says to a human being, “Become disbeliever” then once he
disbelieves, he says, “I disown you; I fear Allah, the Lord of the
worlds.” ⁸</item>
        <item>So the end of both of them is that they will be in the
Fire, living there forever. That is the punishment of the wrongdoers.
</item>
        <item>O you who believe, fear Allah, and everybody must
consider what he (or she) has sent ahead for tomorrow. And fear Allah.
Surely Allah is fully aware of what you do.</item>
        <item>Do not be like those who forgot Allah, so He made them
forget their own selves. ⁹Those are the sinners.</item>
        <item>The people of Hell and the people of Paradise are not
equal. The people of Paradise are the successful.</item>
        <item>Had We sent down this Qur’an to a mountain, you would
have seen it humbled, burst apart out of awe for Allah. We cite such
examples for people, so that they may ponder.</item>
        <item>He is Allah, besides whom there is no god, the Knower of
the unseen and the seen. He is All-Merciful, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>He is Allah, besides whom there is no god, the
Sovereign, the Supreme-In-Holiness, the Safe (from all defects), the
Giver-Of-Peace, the Guardian, the All-Mighty, the All-Repairer, the
Sublime. Pure is Allah from what they associate with Him.</item>
        <item>He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor, the Shaper. ¹⁰His
are the Most Beautiful Names. His purity is proclaimed by all that is
in the heavens and the earth, and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not take My enemies and your
enemies for friends, expressing love with them, while they have
rejected the Truth that has come to you, expelling the Messenger and
your selves (from Makkah) merely because you have faith in Allah who
is your Lord, if you have set out to do Jihad (struggle) in My way,
and to seek My pleasure. You express love with them secretly, while I
know what you have concealed and what you have revealed. Any of you
who does this has missed the straight path.</item>
        <item>Should they have access to you, they will become your
enemies, and will stretch their hands and tongues towards you with
evil; and they desire that you should reject the (true) faith.</item>
        <item>Neither your womb-relations nor your children will
benefit you on the Day of Judgment. He will decide between you, and
Allah is watchful of what you do.</item>
        <item>Indeed, there is an excellent example for you in Ibrahim
and those with him, when they said to their people, “We disown you and
what you worship instead of Allah. We disbelieve in you. Enmity and
hatred has arisen between us and you forever, unless you believe in
Allah alone”,__ but (his example is) not (to be followed) in what
Ibrahim said to his father, “I will pray to my Lord for your
forgiveness, ¹and I have no power from Allah (to do any thing) for
you.” __ “O our Lord, in You alone we trust, and to You alone we turn
for help, and to You is the final return.</item>
        <item>Our Lord, do not make us persecuted by those who
disbelieve, and forgive us, our Lord! You, only You, are the AllMighty, the All-Wise.”</item>
        <item>Indeed, for you there is an excellent example in them,
for anyone who hopes (to meet) Allah and the Last Day. And if one
turns away, Allah is Free of all needs, Worthy of all Praise.</item>
        <item>It is hoped that Allah will bring about love between you
and those of them with whom you have enmity. ²Allah is Powerful, and
Allah is Most-forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Allah does not forbid you as regards those who did not
fight you on account of faith, and did not expel you from your homes,
that you do good to them, and deal justly with them. Surely Allah
loves those who maintain justice.</item>
        <item>Allah forbids you only about those who fought you on
account of faith, and expelled you from your homes, and helped
(others) in expelling you, that you have friendship with them. Those
who develop friendship with them are the wrongdoers.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, when the believing women come to you
as emigrants, put them to a test. Allah knows best about their faith.
So, if you find them faithful, do not send them back to the
disbelievers. ³Neither these (women) are lawful for them, nor are
those (disbelievers) lawful for these (women). And give them (the
disbelievers) that (dower) which they had paid (to these women). And
there is no sin for you if you marry them, when you give them their
dowers. ⁴ And do not hold on to the ties of marriage with the
disbelieving women, ⁵ and ask (their new Non-Muslim husbands to pay to
you) that (dower) which you had paid (to your previous wives), and
they (the previous Non-Muslim husbands of the Muslim women) should ask
(their new Muslim husbands) to pay that (dower) which they had paid
(to their previous wives). That is the decision of Allah. He decides
between you. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>And if some of your (Non-Muslim) wives have slipped from
you, (and their present Non-Muslim husbands do not pay to you the
dower as aforesaid,) and you have your turn (of paying dower to the
previous Non-Muslim husbands of your present wives), then (instead of
paying dower to them,) give those whose wives have slipped the like
amount of what they had paid (to them). And fear Allah, the One in
whom you believe.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, when the believing women come to you,
seeking bai’ah (a pledge of allegiance) with you that they will not
ascribe any partner to Allah, and will not commit theft, and will not
commit fornication,and will not kill their children, and will not come
up with a false claim (about the parentage of a child) that they
falsely attribute (to the sperm of their husbands being dropped)
between their hands and their feet (i.e. their private parts) ⁶, and
will not disobey you in what is recognized (in SharÍ‘ah), then take
them in your bai’ah, and pray Allah for their forgiveness. Surely
Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, do not have friendship with a people
with whom Allah is angry. They have despaired from the Hereafter as
the infidels have despaired from those (buried) in the graves.⁷</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
proclaim Allah’s purity, and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
</item>
        <item>O you who believe, why do you say what you do not do?
¹</item>
        <item>It is severely hateful in Allah’s sight that you say
what you do not do.</item>
        <item>Surely Allah loves those who fight in His way in firm
rows, as if they were solid edifice.</item>
        <item>And (remember) when Musa said to his people, “O my
people, why do you hurt me, while you know that I am a messenger of
Allah sent towards you.” So, when they adopted deviation, Allah let
their hearts become deviate. And Allah does not guide the sinful
people.</item>
        <item>Remember) when ‘Isa, son of Maryam, said, “O children of
Isra’il, I am a messenger of Allah sent towards you, confirming the
Torah that is (sent down) before me, and giving you the good news of a
messenger who will come after me, whose name will be Ahmad.” ²But when
he came to them with manifest signs, they said, “This is a clear
magic.”</item>
        <item>And who is more unjust than the one who forges a lie
against Allah, while he is invited to Islam? And Allah does not guide
the unjust people.</item>
        <item>They wish to extinguish the light of Allah with their
mouths, but Allah is to perfect His light, even though the
disbelievers dislike (it).</item>
        <item>He is the One who has sent His Messenger with guidance
and the religion of truth, so that He makes it prevail over all
religions, even though the mushriks (those who ascribe partners to
Allah) dislike (it).</item>
        <item>O you who believe, shall I tell you about a trade that
saves you from a painful punishment?</item>
        <item>That you believe in Allah and His Messenger, and carry
out Jihad in His way with your riches and your lives. That is much
better for you, if you but know.</item>
        <item>If you do this,) He will forgive your sins, and will
admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow, and to pleasant
dwellings in gardens of eternity. That is the great achievement.
</item>
        <item>And (He will give you) another thing, which you love:
Help from Allah, and victory, near at hand. ³</item>
        <item>O you who believe, be supporters of (the religion of)
Allah, just as ‘Isa, son of Maryam, said to the Disciples, “Who are my
supporters towards Allah?” The Disciples said, “We are the supporters
of (the religion of) Allah.” So a group from the children of Isra’il
believed, and another group disbelieved. Then We supported those who
believed against their enemy, and they became victors.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
proclaim the purity of Allah, the Sovereign, the Supreme in Holiness,
the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.</item>
        <item>He is the One who raised amidst the unlettered people a
messenger from among themselves who recites to them His verses, and
purifies them, and teaches them the Book and the wisdom, while they
were earlier in open error.</item>
        <item>And (this Messenger is sent also) to others from them
who did not join them so far, ¹and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
</item>
        <item>It is Allah’s bounty that He gives to whomsoever He
wills, ²and Allah is the Lord of the great bounty.</item>
        <item>The example of those who were ordered to bear (the
responsibility of acting upon) the Torah, then they did not bear it,
is like a donkey that carries a load of books. Evil is the example of
those who have rejected Allah’s verses. And Allah does not guide the
wrongdoing people.</item>
        <item>Say, “O you who are Jews, if you claim that you are the
friends of Allah to the exclusion of all other people, then express
your desire for death, if you are true.</item>
        <item>And they will never express this desire, because of what
their hands have sent ahead. And Allah is fully aware of the
wrongdoers. ³</item>
        <item>Say, “Indeed, the death from which you (try to) run away
has to visit you, then you will be sent back to the Knower of the
Unseen and the seen, and He will tell you what you used to do.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, when the call for Salah (prayer) is
proclaimed on Friday, hasten for the remembrance of Allah, and leave
off business. That is much better for you, if you but know.</item>
        <item>Then once the Salah is over, disperse in the land, and
seek the grace of Allah, and remember Allah abundantly, so that you
may be successful.</item>
        <item>And when they see some merchandise or amusement, they
break away to it, and leave you (O prophet,) standing. ⁴Say, “What is
with Allah is much better than the amusement and the merchandise, and
Allah is the best giver of sustenance.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>When the hypocrites come to you, they say, “We bear
witness that you are indeed the messenger of Allah.”__Allah knows that
you are really His messenger__But Allah testifies that the hypocrites
are actually liars.</item>
        <item>They have made their oaths a shield, and thus they have
prevented (others) from the way of Allah. Surely evil is what they
have been doing.</item>
        <item>That is because they declared faith (in Islam
apparently), then disbelieved (secretly). Therefore a seal has been
set on their hearts, and thus they do not understand.</item>
        <item>And if you see them, their physiques would attract you,
and if they speak, you would (like to) listen to their speech (because
of their eloquence). (Yet, being devoid of substance,) it is as if
they were propped up beams of timber. They deem every shout (they
hear) to be against them (out of cowardice). They are the enemy; so
beware of them. May Allah destroy them. How perverted are they!</item>
        <item>And when it is said to them, “Come on, so that Allah’s
Messenger may pray for your forgiveness”, they twist their heads (in
aversion), and you see them turning away in arrogance.</item>
        <item>It is equal in their case, whether you (O prophet,) pray
for their forgiveness or do not pray, Allah will never forgive them.
Indeed Allah does not guide the sinning people.</item>
        <item>They are those who say, “Do not spend on those who are
with Allah’s Messenger until they disperse. ¹And to Allah belong the
treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not
understand.</item>
        <item>They say, “If we return to Madinah, the more honorable
ones will drive out the meaner ones from there.” And to Allah belongs
the honour, and to His Messenger, and to the believers, but the
hypocrites do not know.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, your riches and your children must
not divert you from the remembrance of Allah. And those who do that
are the losers.</item>
        <item>And spend out of what We have given to you before death
overtakes one of you and he says, “My Lord, would you not give me
respite to a near term, so that I should pay sadaqah (alms) and become
one of the righteous?”</item>
        <item>But Allah will never give respite to anyone, once his
appointed time will come. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.
</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
proclaim Allah’s purity. To Him belongs the kingdom, and for Him is
all praise, and He is powerful over every thing.</item>
        <item>He is the One who created you, then some of you are
disbelievers, and some of you are believers. And Allah is Watchful of
what you do.</item>
        <item>He has created the heavens and the earth rightly, and
shaped your figures, and made your figures good, and to Him is the
final return.</item>
        <item>He knows all that is in the heavens and the earth, and
He knows whatever you conceal and whatever you reveal. Allah is fully
aware of what lies in the hearts.</item>
        <item>Did the news of those people not come to you who
disbelieved earlier, and tasted (in this world) the evil consequence
of their conduct, and for them (in the Hereafter) there is a painful
punishment?</item>
        <item>That is because their messengers used to bring them
clear proofs, but they said, “Shall some mortals give us guidance?”
Thus they disbelieved and turned away, and Allah did not care. Allah
is All-Independent, Ever-Praised.</item>
        <item>The disbelievers claim that they will never be raised
again (after death). Say, “Why not? By my Lord, you will be raised
again, and then you will be told about what you did. That is so easy
for Allah.”</item>
        <item>So, believe in Allah and His Messenger, and in the light
We have sent down. And Allah is fully aware of what you do.</item>
        <item>Be mindful of) the day when He will gather you for the
Day of Gathering. That will be the Day of loss and gain. ¹Whoever
believes in Allah, and does righteously, He will write off his evil
deeds, and will admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow, where
they will live forever. That is the great achievement.</item>
        <item>As for those who disbelieve and reject Our signs, they
are the people of the Fire. And it is an evil place to return.</item>
        <item>No calamity befalls (one), but with the leave of Allah.
And whoever believes in Allah, He guides his heart. Allah is AllKnowing about every thing.</item>
        <item>Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger. But if you turn
away, then Our Messenger has only to convey the message clearly.
</item>
        <item>Allah is such that there is no god but He. And in Allah
alone the believers must place their trust.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, among your wives and your children
there are some enemies for you, so beware of them. ²And if you forgive
and overlook and pardon, then Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.
³</item>
        <item>Your riches and your children are but a trial. As for
Allah, with Him is a great reward.</item>
        <item>So, observe taqwa (total obedience to Allah in awe of
Him) as far as you can, and listen and obey, and spend (in Allah’s
way), it being good for you. And those who are saved from the greed of
their hearts are the successful.</item>
        <item>If you advance a good loan to Allah, He will multiply it
for you, and will forgive you. And Allah is Appreciative, Forbearing,
</item>
        <item>The Knower of the Unseen and the seen, the All-Mighty,
the All-Wise.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>O prophet, when you people divorce women, divorce them
at a time when the period of ‘Iddah may start. ¹ And count the period
of ‘Iddah, and fear Allah, your Lord. Do not expel them from their
houses, nor should they go out, unless they come up with a clearly
shameless act. ² These are the limits prescribed by Allah. And whoever
exceeds the limits prescribed by Allah wrongs his own self. You do not
know (what will happen in future); it may be that Allah brings about a
new situation thereafter.³</item>
        <item>So, when they (the divorced women) have (almost) reached
their term, then either retain them with fairness, or part with them
with fairness.⁴ And make two just men from among you witnesses (of your
either decision). And (O witnesses,) keep your testimony upright for
the sake of Allah. That is what anyone who believes in Allah and the
Last Day is exhorted to do. Whoever fears Allah, He brings forth a way
out for him,</item>
        <item>And provides him (with what he needs) from where he does
not even imagine. And whoever places his trust in Allah, He is
sufficient for him. Surely Allah is to accomplish His purpose. Allah
has set a measure for every thing.</item>
        <item>And those women from among you who have despaired of
(further) menstruation, if you are in doubt, their ‘Iddah is three
months, as well as of those who have not yet menstruated. As for those
having pregnancy, their term (of ‘Iddah ) is that they give birth to
their child. And whoever fears Allah, He brings about ease for him in
his affair.</item>
        <item>This is the command of Allah that He has sent down to
you. And whoever fears Allah, He will write off his evil deeds, and
will give him a huge reward.</item>
        <item>Provide to them (the divorced women) residence where you
reside according to your means, and do not hurt them to straiten
(life) for them. And if they are pregnant, spend on them till they
give birth to their child. ⁵ Then if they suckle the child for you,
give them their fees, and consult each other (for determining the fee)
with fairness, and if you create a deadlock between you, then another
woman will suckle him.</item>
        <item>A man of vast means should spend according to his vast
means. And anyone whose sustenance is limited should spend from
whatever Allah has given to him. Allah makes no one liable beyond what
He has given to him. Allah will soon bring ease after a difficulty.
</item>
        <item>And how many a township rebelled against the command of
its Lord, and against His messengers, so We called them to a severe
account, and punished them with a punishment that was unimagined by
them.</item>
        <item>Thus they tasted the evil consequence of their acts, and
the end of their conduct was loss.</item>
        <item>Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment; so fear
Allah O men of understanding who have believed! Allah has sent down to
you a Reminder,</item>
        <item>A messenger who recites to you the verses of Allah,
making (the truth) clear, so that He may bring forth those who believe
and do righteous deeds from the layers of darkness into the light. And
whoever believes in Allah, and acts righteously, He will admit him to
the gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein such people will live
forever. Allah has made for him a good provision.</item>
        <item>Allah is the One who has created seven skies, and their
like from earth.⁶ The Command descends among them, ⁷ so that you may
know that Allah is powerful over every thing, and that Allah has
encompassed every thing in knowledge.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>O Prophet, why do you ban (on your self) something that
Allah has made lawful for you, seeking to please your wives? ¹And
Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>Allah has prescribed (the way of) absolution from your
oaths. ²And Allah is your protector, and He is the All- Knowing, the
All-Wise.</item>
        <item>And (remember) when the Prophet told one of his wives
something in secret. So, when she disclosed it (to another wife), and
Allah made it known to him, ³he told (the disclosing wife) part of it,
and avoided another part. ⁴So when he informed her about it, she said,
“Who told you about this?” He said, “I was told of it by the AllKnowing, the All-Aware.</item>
        <item>O two wives of the Prophet,) If both of you repent to
Allah, then (your conduct calls for it, because) your hearts have
departed from the correct way. And if you back each other against him
(the Prophet), then Allah is his supporter, and Jibra’il (Gabriel) and
righteous believers, and after all that, angels are his helpers.
</item>
        <item>It is hoped that, if he divorces you, Allah will give
him in your place wives better than you, submissive to Allah,
believing, devout, penitent, steadfast in worship, fasting, previously
married and virgins.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, save yourselves and your families
from a fire, the fuel of which is human beings and stones, appointed
on which are angels, stern and severe, who do not disobey Allah in
what He orders them, and do whatever they are ordered to do.</item>
        <item>O you who disbelieve, do not make excuses today. You
will only be recompensed for what you have been doing.</item>
        <item>O you who believe, turn to Allah with a faithful
repentance. It is hoped from your Lord that he will write off your
faults, and will admit you to the gardens beneath which rivers flow,
on the Day when Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who
believed with him. Their light will run before them and to their right
hands. They will say, “Our Lord, perfect for us our light, and forgive
us. Indeed you are powerful over every thing.”</item>
        <item>O Prophet, carry out Jihad (struggle) against the
disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be harsh with them. ⁵Their final
abode is Jahannam (Hell), and it is an evil end.</item>
        <item>Allah has cited for the disbelievers the example of the
wife of Nuh and the wife of Lut. Both were married with two of Our
righteous servants, but betrayed them. So they could not benefit them
against Allah at all, and it was said, “Enter the Fire along with
those who enter.” ⁶</item>
        <item>And Allah has cited for the believers the example of the
wife of Fir’aun (Pharaoh), when she said, “My Lord, build for me, near
You, a house in the Paradise, and deliver me from Fir’aun and his
deeds, and deliver me from the unjust people.”</item>
        <item>And (Allah has also cited the example of) Maryam,
daughter of ‘Imran who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her
Our spirit, and she testified to the truth of the words of her Lord
and His books, and she was one of the devout.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Glorious is the One in whose hand is the Kingdom (of the
whole universe), and He is powerful over every thing,</item>
        <item>The One who created death and life, so that He may test
you as to which of you is better in his deeds. And He is the AllMighty, the Most-Forgiving,</item>
        <item>Who has created seven skies, one over the other. You
will see nothing out of proportion in the creation of the Rahman (the
All-Merciful Allah). So, cast your eye again. Do you see any rifts?
</item>
        <item>Then cast your eye again and again, and the eye will
come back to you abased, in a state of weariness.</item>
        <item>And We have decorated the nearest sky with lamps, and
have made them devices to stone the devils, ¹and We have prepared for
them the punishment of Hell.</item>
        <item>And for those who disbelieved in their Lord, there is
the punishment of Jahannam , and it is an evil end.</item>
        <item>When they will be thrown in it, they will hear a
terrible sound from it, and it will be boiling,</item>
        <item>Seeming as if it will burst out of fury. Whenever a
group is thrown into it, its keepers will say to them, “Had no warner
come to you?”</item>
        <item>They will say, “Yes, a warner had come to us, but We had
rejected, and said, ‘Allah has not revealed anything. You are only in
great error.’”</item>
        <item>And they will say, “Had we been listening or
understanding, we would not have been among the people of the
Hell.”</item>
        <item>Thus they will confess their sin. So, away with the
people of the Hell!</item>
        <item>Surely, for those who have awe of their Lord without
seeing (Him), there is forgiveness and a big reward.</item>
        <item>Whether you keep your talk secret or make it aloud, He
knows well what lies in the hearts.</item>
        <item>Is it (imaginable) that He who has created (them) will
not have (such a) knowledge, while He is the Knower of the finest
things, the All-Aware?</item>
        <item>He is the One who has made the earth subjugated for you,
so walk on its shoulders, and eat out of His provision, and to Him is
the Resurrection.</item>
        <item>Have you become fearless of Him who is in the sky if He
makes you sink into the earth, and it starts trembling at once?</item>
        <item>Or, have you become fearless of Him who is in the sky if
He looses a violent wind with stones against you? So, you will soon
come to know how was My warning!</item>
        <item>And of course, those before them (also) rejected (the
truth). So, how was My censure?</item>
        <item>Have they not looked to the birds above them spreading
their wings, and (at times) they fold (them) in? No one holds them up
except the Rahman (the All-Merciful Allah). Surely He is watchful of
every thing.</item>
        <item>Now, who is there to act as a force for you to help you,
except the Rahman ? The disbelievers are in nothing but delusion.
</item>
        <item>Or, who is there to give you sustenance, if He withholds
His sustenance? Still, they persist in rebellion and aversion.</item>
        <item>Then, is the one who walks falling down (frequently) on
his face more right or the one who walks properly on a straight path?
</item>
        <item>Say, “He is the One who has originated you, and made for
you ears and eyes and hearts. How little you pay gratitude!”</item>
        <item>Say, “He is the One who has scattered you on the earth,
and to Him you will be assembled.”</item>
        <item>And they say, “When will this promise (of the Day of
Judgment) be fulfilled, if you are true?”</item>
        <item>Say, “The knowledge (of that Day) is only with Allah,
and I am only a plain warner.</item>
        <item>Then, once they will see it approaching, the faces of
the disbelievers will be turned awkward, and it will be said, “This is
what you were calling for!”</item>
        <item>Say, “Tell me, if Allah destroys me and those who are
with me (as you wish), or has mercy on us (as we wish), who can (in
either case) save the disbelievers from a painful punishment?”</item>
        <item>Say, “He is the Rahman; we have believed in Him, and in
Him we placed our trust. So, you will soon come to know who is in open
error.”</item>
        <item>Say, “Tell me, Should your water vanish into the earth,
who will bring you a flowing (stream of) water?</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Nun , ¹by the pen and what they write,</item>
        <item>With the grace of your Lord, you are not insane.
²</item>
        <item>And you will definitely have a reward that will never
end.</item>
        <item>And you are surely on an excellent standard of
character.</item>
        <item>So, you will see, and they will see</item>
        <item>Which of you is demented.</item>
        <item>Surely your Lord knows best who has strayed from his
way, and He is well aware of those who are on the right path.</item>
        <item>So, do not obey those who reject (the true faith.)
</item>
        <item>They wish that you become flexible (in your faith), so
that they should become flexible (in their hostile attitude.) ³</item>
        <item>And do not obey any contemptible one who swears much,
</item>
        <item>A slanderer who goes about with calumnies,</item>
        <item>One who prevents good, (and who is) transgressor,
sinful,</item>
        <item>Harsh, (and) after all that, notorious,</item>
        <item>Do not obey such a person merely) because he is a man of
wealth and sons.</item>
        <item>When Our verses are recited to him, he says, “(These
are) the tales of the ancient.” ⁴</item>
        <item>We will soon brand him on the snout.</item>
        <item>We have tested them as We had tested the Owners of the
Garden, ⁵when they had sworn an oath that they would pluck its fruits
on the next morning,</item>
        <item>And did not make any exception (by saying insha’allah ).
</item>
        <item>Then, there whirled around it a whirl (of calamity) from
your Lord, while they were asleep.</item>
        <item>Thus, on the next morning, it was like a harvested
field.</item>
        <item>So, they called out each other as the morning broke,
</item>
        <item>Saying, “Set out early, if you are going to pluck (the
fruits).”</item>
        <item>So they set out while they were whispering to each
other,</item>
        <item>Saying, “Let no poor man enter into it upon you
today.”</item>
        <item>And in early hours they rushed quickly, while they were
(assuming themselves) powerful (to pluck the fruits and prevent the
poor.)</item>
        <item>But when they saw it (the place of the ruined garden),
they said, “We have missed the way.”</item>
        <item>Then, once they realized that the garden is the same,
but it has been destroyed, they said,) “No, but we are deprived (of
the fruits).”</item>
        <item>Said he who was the best among them, “Did I not say to
you, ‘Why do you not pronounce tasbih (Allah’s purity)?”</item>
        <item>They said, “We pronounce the purity of our Lord. No
doubt, we were wrongdoers.”</item>
        <item>Then, (at the beginning,) they started reproaching one
another;</item>
        <item>And at last,) they said, “Woe to us! In fact, we (all)
were outrageous.</item>
        <item>We hope that our Lord will give us in exchange something
better than this. Truly we turn to our Lord.” ⁶</item>
        <item>In this way the punishment comes. And, of course, the
punishment of the Hereafter is even greater, if they but realize!
</item>
        <item>Surely, for the God-fearing there are gardens of bliss.
</item>
        <item>Otherwise, shall We make the obedient like the sinners?
</item>
        <item>What has happened to you? How do you judge?</item>
        <item>Do you have a book in which you read</item>
        <item>That for you there is what you choose? ⁷</item>
        <item>Or do you have oaths sworn by Us, remaining effective up
to the Day of Judgment, that you will get what you decide?</item>
        <item>Ask them which of them stands surety for that.</item>
        <item>Or do they have associate-gods (who have guaranteed
safety for them)? Then, let them bring their associate-gods, if they
are true.</item>
        <item>On the Day when the Shin will be exposed, ⁸and they will
be called upon to prostrate themselves, they will not be able to.
</item>
        <item>With their eyes downcast, they will be enveloped by
ignominy. They used to be called upon to prostrate when they were
healthy (but they did not.)</item>
        <item>So, leave Me alone with those who reject this discourse.
We will draw them on little by little (towards Hell) from a way they
do not know.</item>
        <item>And I give them respite. Indeed, My plan is firm.</item>
        <item>Is it that you ask them for a fee, due to which they are
burdened with debt?</item>
        <item>Or do they have the (knowledge of the) Unseen, and they
write it down?</item>
        <item>So, remain patient with your Lord’s judgment, and be not
like the Man of the Fish, ⁹he cried out while he was in anguish.</item>
        <item>Had not a favour from His Lord come to his help, he
would have been cast in the wilderness in a reproachable state.
¹⁰</item>
        <item>Then his Lord chose him, and made him one of the
righteous.</item>
        <item>And indeed the disbelievers seem to trip you up with
their glances ¹¹when they hear the Reminder, and say, “He is a madman
indeed.”</item>
        <item>And it is nothing else but a Reminder for all the
worlds.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>The Imminent Happening!</item>
        <item>What is the Imminent Happening?</item>
        <item>And what can let you know what the Imminent happening
is? ¹</item>
        <item>Thamud and ‘Ad had denied (the happening of) the
Shocking Event (the Day of Judgment).</item>
        <item>As for Thamud, they were destroyed by that (dreadful
cry), which exceeded all limits.</item>
        <item>And as for ‘Ad, they were destroyed by a violent
windstorm</item>
        <item>That He imposed on them for seven nights and eight
consecutive days; so you could see them thrown on the ground, as if
they were trunks of hollow palm-trees.</item>
        <item>Now, do you see any remnant of them? ²</item>
        <item>And Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and those before him and the
overthrown towns ³came up with evil,</item>
        <item>And they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, so He
seized them with an extremely severe seizure.</item>
        <item>When the water overflowed (in the Deluge of Nuh), We let
you (O mankind,) board the floating ship, ⁴</item>
        <item>So that We make it a reminder for you, and so that a
preserving ear (that hears their story) may preserve it.</item>
        <item>Then, once the Trumpet will be blown for the first time,
</item>
        <item>And the earth and the mountains will be lifted and
crushed into pieces with a single blow,</item>
        <item>Then on that Day the Happening will happen,</item>
        <item>And the sky will burst apart, while it will have become
frail on that day.</item>
        <item>And the angels will be on its borders. And on that Day,
the Throne of your Lord will be carried above them by eight (angels).
</item>
        <item>On that day, you will be brought forward in a way that
no secret of yours will remain secret.</item>
        <item>Now, as for him who is given his book in his right hand,
he will say (to his colleagues), “Come here, read my book.</item>
        <item>I was sure that I would encounter my reckoning.”</item>
        <item>So he will be in a well-pleasing life</item>
        <item>In a lofty garden,</item>
        <item>The fruits of which will be close at hand.</item>
        <item>It will be said to such people,) “Eat and drink with
pleasure, as a reward for what you did in advance during past
days.”</item>
        <item>As for him who will be given his book in his left hand,
he will say, “ Oh, would that I had not been given my book,</item>
        <item>And I had never known what my account is!</item>
        <item>Oh, would that it (death) had been the end of the
matter!</item>
        <item>My wealth has not been of any use to me.</item>
        <item>My power has gone from me for good.”</item>
        <item>Then it will be said to angels,) “Seize him, then put a
collar around his neck,</item>
        <item>And then, let him burn in the blazing fire.</item>
        <item>Thereafter, fasten him with a chain the measure of which
is seventy hands.”</item>
        <item>Indeed, he did not believe in Allah, the Almighty,
</item>
        <item>And did not persuade (others) to feed the needy.</item>
        <item>So, he has no friend here today,</item>
        <item>Nor any food except that which comes out from wounds
when washing,</item>
        <item>Which is eaten by none but the sinners.</item>
        <item>I swear by what you see,</item>
        <item>And what you do not see,</item>
        <item>It is surely the speech of a noble Messenger, (that he
conveys from Allah).</item>
        <item>And it is not the speech of a poet, (but) little you
believe,</item>
        <item>Nor is it the speech of a soothsayer, (but) little you
heed to the advice.</item>
        <item>It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.</item>
        <item>Had he (the prophet) forged some statements in Our name,
</item>
        <item>We would have certainly seized him by the right hand,
</item>
        <item>And then severed his life-artery,</item>
        <item>And none of you could have saved him from it. ⁵</item>
        <item>It is infact a Reminder for the God-fearing.</item>
        <item>And, of course, We know that among you there are
deniers.</item>
        <item>And surely, it is a cause of remorse for the
disbelievers.</item>
        <item>And it is surely an absolute truth.</item>
        <item>So, pronounce the purity of the name of your magnificent
Lord.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>A demanding person has asked for the punishment that is
going to befall</item>
        <item>The disbelievers; there is no one to avert it, ¹</item>
        <item>And it will come) from Allah, the Lord of the stairways,
</item>
        <item>To whom ascend the angels and the Spirit ²in a day the
length of which is fifty thousand years. ³</item>
        <item>So, observe patience, a good patience.</item>
        <item>They see it far off,</item>
        <item>And We see it near.</item>
        <item>This punishment will befall) on the Day when the sky
will be like dregs of oil,</item>
        <item>And the mountains will be like dyed wool,</item>
        <item>And no friend will ask about any friend,</item>
        <item>Though) they will be made to see each other. A guilty
person will desire that he may be able to ransom himself from the
torment of that day even by his sons,</item>
        <item>And his wife and his brother,</item>
        <item>And his kindred that sheltered him,</item>
        <item>And all those on earth, then he may redeem himself.
</item>
        <item>By no means! It is the flaming fire</item>
        <item>That will pull out the skin of the scalp.</item>
        <item>It will call him who had turned his back and fled away
(from the truth)</item>
        <item>And accumulated (wealth) and hoarded (it).</item>
        <item>Indeed man is created weak in courage,</item>
        <item>Very upset when touched by evil,</item>
        <item>And very niggard when visited by good (fortune),</item>
        <item>Except the performers of Salah,</item>
        <item>Who are regular in their Salah,</item>
        <item>And those in whose riches there is a specified
right</item>
        <item>For the one who asks and the one who is deprived,</item>
        <item>And those who believe in the Day of Judgment as true,
</item>
        <item>And those who are fearful of the torment of their
Lord__</item>
        <item>Indeed the torment of their Lord is not something to be
fearless from.__</item>
        <item>And those who guard their private parts,</item>
        <item>Except from their wives and those (slave-girls) owned by
their hands,__ because they are not to be blamed,</item>
        <item>But the one who seeks (sexual gratification) beyond
that, then such people are the transgressors,__</item>
        <item>And those who are careful about their trusts and
covenants,</item>
        <item>And those who are upright in their testimonies,</item>
        <item>And those who take due care of their Salah .</item>
        <item>Those will be honoured in gardens (of Jannah ).</item>
        <item>So what has happened to those who disbelieve that they
are rushing towards you</item>
        <item>From the right and from the left, in groups?</item>
        <item>Does every one of them aspire to be admitted to the
garden of bliss? ⁴</item>
        <item>By no means! We have created them from what they know.
</item>
        <item>⁵So, I swear by the Lord of the points of sunrise and
those of sunset, We are powerful</item>
        <item>To bring those better than them in their place, and We
are not to be frustrated.</item>
        <item>So, leave them involved in pastime and play until they
encounter their Day, which they are promised,</item>
        <item>The Day they will come out of the graves quickly, as if
they were rushing toward idols,</item>
        <item>With their eyes downcast, enveloped by ignominy. That is
the Day, which they were being promised.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>We sent Nuh ¹to his people (and said to him): “Warn your
people before a painful punishment comes to them.”</item>
        <item>He said, “O my people, I openly warn you</item>
        <item>That you must worship Allah, and fear Him, and obey me,
</item>
        <item>And Allah will forgive you your sins, and will respite
you to an appointed term. Indeed when Allah’s term comes, it is not
deferred, if you only know!”</item>
        <item>He said, “My Lord, I have called my people night and
day,</item>
        <item>But my call added only to their flight (from the truth).
</item>
        <item>Whenever I called them, so that You might forgive them,
they put their fingers into their ears, and wrapped their clothes
around themselves, and grew obstinate, and waxed proud in extreme
arrogance.</item>
        <item>Then I called them loudly,</item>
        <item>And then I spoke to them in public and spoke to them in
private.</item>
        <item>So I said, ‘Pray to your Lord for your forgiveness,__
Indeed He is Very-Forgiving, __</item>
        <item>And He will cause the heavens to rain upon you in
abundance,</item>
        <item>And will help you with riches and sons, and will cause
gardens to grow for you, and cause rivers to flow for you.</item>
        <item>What has happened to you that you do not appreciate the
Majesty of Allah,</item>
        <item>While He has created you in different phases?</item>
        <item>Did you not see how Allah has created seven heavens one
upon another,</item>
        <item>And has made the moon a light therein, and made the sun
a lamp?</item>
        <item>And Allah has caused you to grow well out of the earth,
²</item>
        <item>Then He will send you back into it, and will bring you
forth once again.</item>
        <item>And Allah has made the earth a spread for you,</item>
        <item>So that you may go about its broad ways.’”</item>
        <item>And said Nuh, “My Lord, they disobeyed me, and followed
him whose wealth and children added nothing to him but loss,</item>
        <item>And they devised a mighty plot,</item>
        <item>And said (to their people), “Never forsake your gods,
and never forsake Wadd, nor Suwa‘, nor Yaghuth and Ya‘uq and Nasr.
³</item>
        <item>And they have led many astray. And (O my Lord,) let not
the wrongdoers progress in anything but deviation from the right
path.” ⁴</item>
        <item>Because of their sins they were drowned, and then
admitted into the Fire. So they found no helpers for them besides
Allah.</item>
        <item>And said Nuh, “My Lord, do not leave on earth even a
single inhabitant (surviving) out of the disbelievers.</item>
        <item>If You leave them (surviving), they will lead Your
servants astray, and will beget none but a sinful disbeliever.</item>
        <item>My Lord, grant pardon to me, and to my parents, and to
everyone who enters my home as a believer, and to all the believing
men and believing women, and do not increase the wrongdoers but in
ruin.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Say, “It has been revealed to me that a group from Jinn
has listened (to the Qur’an), and said (to their people), ‘Indeed we
have heard an amazing Recital (Qur’an)</item>
        <item>That guides to the right way, so we have believed in it,
and we will never associate a partner with our Lord.’ ¹</item>
        <item>And (then the Jinns started talking to each other) that
exalted is the Glory of our Lord; He has taken neither a wife, nor a
son,</item>
        <item>And that the fools among us used to attribute to Allah
extremely absurd things,</item>
        <item>And that we thought that the humans and the Jinn would
never tell a lie about Allah, (therefore, we had followed them in
shirk under this impression),</item>
        <item>And that some guys from human beings used to seek refuge
with some guys of the Jinn, and thus they increased them (the Jinns)
in arrogance, ²</item>
        <item>And that they (humans) thought as you (O Jinns) thought
that Allah will never resurrect anyone,</item>
        <item>And that we sought (to reach) the sky, but we found it
filled with stern guards and flames,</item>
        <item>And that we used to sit at places therein to listen; but
if one will (try to) listen now, he will find a flame in ambush for
him, ³</item>
        <item>And that we do not know whether it is a bad end that is
intended for those on earth, or their Lord has intended for them a
right thing, ⁴</item>
        <item>And that some of us are (already) righteous, and some of
us are otherwise, and we were on different ways;</item>
        <item>And that we have now believed that we can never
frustrate Allah on the earth, nor can we baffle Him by escape,</item>
        <item>And that when we heard the Guiding Discourse, we
believed in it; so if one believes in his Lord, he will have no fear
of either any curtailment (in his reward) or any excess (in his
punishment),</item>
        <item>And that some of us are Muslims, and some of us are
unjust. Now, those who submitted to Islam have found out the right
path,</item>
        <item>As for the unjust, they have become firewood for
Hell.”</item>
        <item>And it is also revealed to me) that if they (the people
of Makkah) had stood firm on the (right) way, We would have supplied
water to them in abundance,</item>
        <item>So that We test them thereby; and if one turns away from
the remembrance of his Lord, He will thrust him into a severe torment,
</item>
        <item>And that masajid (mosques) belong to Allah; ⁵so, do not
invoke anyone along with Allah,</item>
        <item>And that when Allah’s servant stood invoking Him, they
almost rushed on him in crowds.” ⁶</item>
        <item>Say, “I invoke my Lord, and do not associate anyone with
Him.”</item>
        <item>Say, “I possess no power to cause you any harm or bring
you to a right way.”</item>
        <item>Say, “No one can ever save me from Allah, and I can
never find a refuge save with Him.</item>
        <item>However, (I have been given power) of conveying
(commands) from Allah, and His messages. The one who disobeys Allah
and His Messenger, for him there is the fire of Hell, wherein such
people will live forever.</item>
        <item>The disbelievers will continue denying the truth and
mock at it) until when they will see what they are promised, they will
know whose supporters are weaker, and whose numbers are less.</item>
        <item>Say, “I do not know whether that which you are promised
is near, or my Lord has appointed for it a distant term. ⁷</item>
        <item>He is the) Knower of the Unseen. So He does not let
anyone know the Unseen created by Him,</item>
        <item>Except a messenger whom He chooses (to inform through
revelation), and then He appoints (angels as) watching guards before
him and behind him, (so that devils may not tamper with the divine
revelation,)</item>
        <item>So that He knows that they (angels) have conveyed the
messages of their Lord. And He has encompassed all that is with them,
and has comprehensive knowledge of every thing by numbers.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>O you, wrapped up in clothes, ¹</item>
        <item>Stand at night (for prayer) except a little__</item>
        <item>Half of it, or make it a little less,</item>
        <item>Or make it a little more; ²and recite the Qur’an clearly
with tartil (in a distinct and measured tone).</item>
        <item>We are going to send down to you a weighty discourse.
</item>
        <item>Truly, rising by night (for prayer of tahajjud ) is the
most effective way to subdue (one’s base self) and to make speech more
upright.</item>
        <item>Surely, in daytime, you have a lengthy work to do.
</item>
        <item>And remember the name of your Lord, and devote yourself
to Him with exclusive devotion.</item>
        <item>He is the Lord of the East and the West; there is no god
but He; so take Him for (your) Guardian.</item>
        <item>And bear patiently what they (the opponents) say, and
part with them in a beautiful manner.</item>
        <item>And leave Me alone (to deal) with the deniers, the
people of luxury, and give them respite for a while.</item>
        <item>Surely with Us are fetters and flaming fire,</item>
        <item>And food that chokes, and a painful punishment</item>
        <item>On the Day when the earth and the mountains will quake,
and the mountains will turn into a slipping heap of sand.</item>
        <item>O people,) We have sent to you a messenger, as a witness
over you, just as We sent a messenger to Fir‘aun (Pharaoh).</item>
        <item>Then, Fir‘aun disobeyed the messenger; so We seized him
with a severe seizure.</item>
        <item>So, if you disbelieve, how will you save yourself from a
day that will turn the small boys into grey-headed old men, ³</item>
        <item>Whereby the sky will burst apart. His promise has to be
fulfilled.</item>
        <item>Indeed, this is a reminder; so let anyone who so wishes,
adopt a way to his Lord.</item>
        <item>Your Lord knows that you stand (in prayer) for nearly
two thirds of the night, and (at times) for half of it, and (at times)
for one third of it, and (so do) a group of those who are with you.
And Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you (O
Muslims,) cannot do it in regular way; therefore He turned to you in
mercy.Now, recite as much of the Qur’an as is easy (for you). ⁴He knows
that some of you may be sick, and others traveling in the land,
seeking the grace of Allah, ⁵ and yet others fighting in Allah’s way.
Therefore, recite as much of it as is easy. And establish ÞalÉh, and
pay ZakÉh, and advance to Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you
will send ahead for your own-selves, you will find it with Allah much
better in condition, and much greater in reward. And seek forgiveness
from Allah. Indeed Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>O you, enveloped in a mantle, ¹</item>
        <item>Stand up and warn,</item>
        <item>And pronounce the greatness of your Lord,</item>
        <item>And purify your clothes,</item>
        <item>And keep away from filth, ²</item>
        <item>And do not do a favour (to anyone merely) to seek more
(in return).</item>
        <item>And for the sake of your Lord, observe patience.
³</item>
        <item>For when the trumpet will be blown,</item>
        <item>That day will be a difficult day,</item>
        <item>Not easy for the disbelievers.</item>
        <item>Leave me alone (to deal) with the one whom I created
lonely, ⁴</item>
        <item>And gave him extensive wealth,</item>
        <item>And sons present before (his) eyes,</item>
        <item>And extended (power and honour) to him pretty well.
</item>
        <item>Still, he aspires that I should give him more. ⁵</item>
        <item>Never! He is inimical towards Our verses.</item>
        <item>I will force him to climb the mountain sa‘ud . ⁶</item>
        <item>He pondered and surmised. ⁷</item>
        <item>Death onto him! How (bad) is the surmise he put forward!
</item>
        <item>Again, death unto him! How (bad) is the surmise he put
forward!</item>
        <item>Then he looked (to those around him,)</item>
        <item>Then he frowned and scowled,</item>
        <item>Then turned his back, and waxed proud,</item>
        <item>Then said, “This is nothing but traditional magic;
</item>
        <item>This is nothing but saying of a mortal.”</item>
        <item>I will put him into Saqar (Hell).</item>
        <item>And what can let you know what Saqar is?</item>
        <item>It neither spares (anything inside it from burning) nor
leaves (any disbeliever outside).</item>
        <item>It will disfigure the skins.</item>
        <item>Appointed on it are nineteen (wardens).</item>
        <item>And We did not make wardens of the Fire but (from)
angels, and did not fix their number but as a test for those who
disbelieve, ⁸ so that those who are given the Book may come to believe,
⁹ and those who believe may improve in belief, and so that those who
are given the Book and those who believe may not doubt (its
correctness), and so that those having malady in their hearts and the
disbelievers say, “What has Allah meant by this strange
statement?”Thus Allah lets go astray whomever He wills, and leads to
the right path whomever He wills. And no one knows the hosts of your
Lord but He. And this is nothing else but a reminder for mankind.
</item>
        <item>Truly, I swear by the moon,</item>
        <item>And by the night when it goes back,</item>
        <item>And by the morning when it becomes bright,</item>
        <item>It (Saqar : Hell) is one of the greatest things</item>
        <item>As a warning to the mankind,</item>
        <item>To the one from among you who wishes to come forward
(towards good deeds) or to go back (from them).</item>
        <item>Everyone will be detained (in the Hell) because of what
he did,</item>
        <item>Except the People of the Right, (i.e. those who will be
given their Book of Deeds in their right hands)</item>
        <item>Who will be in gardens, asking</item>
        <item>About the guilty persons,</item>
        <item>What has brought you to Saqar? (Hell)”</item>
        <item>They will say, “We were not among those who offered
Salah , (obligatory prayer)</item>
        <item>And we did not give food to the needy,</item>
        <item>And we indulged (in mocking at the truth) along with
those who indulged,</item>
        <item>And we used to deny the Day of Requital,</item>
        <item>Until when we were overtaken by that which is certain.”
¹⁰</item>
        <item>Then intercession of intercessors will not benefit them.
</item>
        <item>So what has happened to them that they are turning away
from the Reminder,</item>
        <item>As if they were wild donkeys,</item>
        <item>Fleeing from a lion?</item>
        <item>Rather, every one of them wishes that he should be given
unrolled (divine) scriptures.</item>
        <item>Never! But they do not fear the Hereafter.</item>
        <item>Never! Indeed, this is a Reminder.</item>
        <item>So, whoever so wishes may take advice from it.</item>
        <item>And they will not take advice unless Allah so wills. He
is worthy to be feared, and worthy to forgive.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>I swear by the Day of Resurrection,</item>
        <item>And I swear by the self-reproaching conscience, (that
Resurrection is a reality.)</item>
        <item>Does man think that We will never reassemble his bones?
</item>
        <item>Why (can We) not (do so), while We are able to reset
(even) his fingertips perfectly? ¹</item>
        <item>But man wishes to go on violating Allah’s injunctions
(even in future) ahead of him.</item>
        <item>He asks, “When will be this Day of Resurrection?”</item>
        <item>So, when the eyes will be dazzled,</item>
        <item>And the moon will lose its light,</item>
        <item>And the sun and the moon will be joined together,
²</item>
        <item>On that day man will say, “Where to escape?”</item>
        <item>Never! There will be no refuge at all.</item>
        <item>On that day, towards your Lord will be the destination
(of everyone.)</item>
        <item>Man will be informed of what he sent ahead and what he
left behind.</item>
        <item>Rather, man will be a witness against himself,</item>
        <item>Even though he may offer his excuses.</item>
        <item>O Prophet,) do not move your tongue (during revelation)
for (reciting) it (the Qur’an) to receive it in hurry. ³</item>
        <item>It is surely undertaken by Us to store it (in your
heart), and to let it be recited (by you after revelation is
completed).</item>
        <item>Therefore, when it is recited by Us (through the angel),
follow its recitation (by concentration of your heart).</item>
        <item>Then, it is undertaken by Us to explain it.</item>
        <item>Never, (your denial of Resurrection is never based on
any sound reason!) Instead, you love that which is immediate,</item>
        <item>And neglect the Hereafter.</item>
        <item>Many faces, that day, will be glowing,</item>
        <item>Looking towards their Lord,</item>
        <item>And many faces, that day, will be gloomy,</item>
        <item>Realizing that a back-breaking calamity is going to be
afflicted on them.</item>
        <item>Never, (you will never remain in this world forever!)
When the soul (of a patient) reaches the clavicles,</item>
        <item>And it is said, “Who is an enchanter (that can save
him?)” ⁴</item>
        <item>And he realizes that it is (the time of) departure (from
the world,)</item>
        <item>And one shank is intertwined with the other shank,
⁵</item>
        <item>Then on that day, it is to your Lord that one has to be
driven.</item>
        <item>So (the denier of the Hereafter) neither believed, nor
prayed,</item>
        <item>But rejected the truth and turned away (from it),</item>
        <item>Then he went to his home, puffed up with pride.</item>
        <item>It will be said to such a man,) Woe to you, then woe to
you!</item>
        <item>Again, woe to you, then woe to you!</item>
        <item>Does man presume that he will be left unchecked?</item>
        <item>Was he not an ejaculated drop of semen?</item>
        <item>Then he became a clot of blood, then He created (him)
and made (him) perfect,</item>
        <item>And made from him two kinds, male and female.</item>
        <item>Has He no power to give life to the dead?</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>There has come upon man a period of time in which he was
nothing worth mentioning.</item>
        <item>We have created man from a mixed sperm-drop to put him
to a test; then We made him able to hear, able to see.</item>
        <item>We have shown him the way to be either grateful or
ungrateful.</item>
        <item>We have prepared, for the disbelievers, shackles and
iron-collars and a blazing Fire.</item>
        <item>Indeed, the righteous will have a drink from a goblet,
blended with (a drink from) Camphor</item>
        <item>That will be a spring from which Allah’s servants will
drink, making it flow (wherever they wish) profusely. ¹</item>
        <item>They (are the ones who) fulfill their vows, and fear a
day whose evil (events) will spread far and wide,</item>
        <item>And they give food, out of their love for Him (Allah),
to the needy, and the orphan, and the captive,</item>
        <item>Saying to them,) “We feed you only for the sake of
Allah; we have no intention of (receiving) either a return from you or
thanks.</item>
        <item>In fact, we are fearful of a day, from the side of our
Lord, that will be frowning, extremely malignant.”</item>
        <item>So Allah will save them from the evil of that day, and
will grant them bloom and delight,</item>
        <item>And will give them, in return for their patience,
Paradise and (garments of) silk,</item>
        <item>Wherein they will be reclining on couches, feeling
neither heat of the sun nor intense cold.</item>
        <item>And shades of gardens will be hanging low on them, and
their fruits will be placed totally under their command.</item>
        <item>Circulated among them will be vessels of silver, and
cups that will be (as transparent as) crystals,</item>
        <item>Crystals (as shining as if made) of silver, ²measured by
those (who filled them) with due measure.</item>
        <item>And they will be served with goblet of a drink blended
with ginger,</item>
        <item>Acquired from) a spring therein called Salsabil.</item>
        <item>And circling around them will be serving boys, blessed
with eternal youth; when you would see them, you would take them as
scattered pearls.</item>
        <item>When you will look around there, you will see the Bliss
and a magnificent realm.</item>
        <item>Upon them will be garments of green sundus (a kind of
fine silk), and of istabraq (a kind of thick silk), and they will be
adorned by bracelets of silver. Their Lord will give them a pure
beverage to drink:</item>
        <item>This is a reward for you, and your effort has been
appreciated.”</item>
        <item>Indeed we have revealed to you the Qur’an through a
gradual process.</item>
        <item>So, be steadfast patiently in (obeying) your Lord’s
command, and do not obey any one of them who is sinner or ungrateful.
</item>
        <item>And pronounce the name of Allah morning and evening.
</item>
        <item>And in some parts of night prostrate yourself before
Him, and pronounce His purity for long times at night.</item>
        <item>In fact these people love that which is immediate, and
neglect a Heavy Day ahead of them.</item>
        <item>We have created them and have made their joints strong.
And whenever We will, We would replace them with others like them, a
total replacement.</item>
        <item>Indeed, this is a reminder; so let anyone who so wishes,
adopt a way to his Lord.</item>
        <item>And you will not so wish unless Allah so wills. ³Indeed
Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</item>
        <item>He admits whomsoever He wills to His mercy. As for the
wrongdoers, He has prepared for them a painful punishment.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>I swear) by those (winds) that are sent one after the
other,</item>
        <item>And by those that blow violently,</item>
        <item>And by those that spread (clouds) all over,</item>
        <item>And by those (angels) who differentiate (between right
and wrong) distinctly,</item>
        <item>Then bring down the advice,</item>
        <item>Leaving no excuse (for the disbelievers) or giving
warnings,</item>
        <item>That which you are promised is sure to happen. ¹</item>
        <item>So, when the stars will be extinguished,</item>
        <item>And when the sky will be split,</item>
        <item>And when the mountains will be blown away as dust,
</item>
        <item>And when the messengers will be assembled at the
appointed time, (then all matters will be decided.)</item>
        <item>Do you know) for which day has all this been delayed?
</item>
        <item>For the Day of Decision!</item>
        <item>And what may let you know what the Day of Decision is?
</item>
        <item>Woe that Day to the deniers!</item>
        <item>Did We not destroy the earlier people?</item>
        <item>Then We will cause the later ones to follow them.</item>
        <item>Thus We deal with the guilty people.</item>
        <item>Woe that Day to the deniers!</item>
        <item>Did We not create you from a worthless fluid? ²</item>
        <item>Then We put it in a firm place of rest</item>
        <item>For a known period.³</item>
        <item>Thus We did (all this with perfect) measure; so We are
the best to measure.</item>
        <item>Woe that Day to the deniers!</item>
        <item>Did We not make the earth a container that
collects</item>
        <item>The living and the dead?</item>
        <item>And We placed towering mountains therein, and provided
you with sweet water to drink.</item>
        <item>Woe that Day to the deniers!</item>
        <item>It will be said to them on that day, Push on to what you
used to deny.</item>
        <item>Push on to a canopy (of Hell’s smoke) having three
branches,</item>
        <item>That neither has a comfortable shade, nor is it of any
use against the scorching heat.</item>
        <item>It emits sparks (as huge) as castles,</item>
        <item>As if they were yellowish camels.”</item>
        <item>Woe that Day to the deniers!</item>
        <item>This is the day when they will not speak,</item>
        <item>Nor will they be allowed to offer excuses.</item>
        <item>Woe that Day to the deniers!</item>
        <item>It will be said to them,) “This is the Day of Decision.
We have assembled you and the earlier ones together.</item>
        <item>Now, if you have a trick, use the trick against
Me.”</item>
        <item>Woe that Day to the deniers!</item>
        <item>Of course, the God-fearing will be amid shades and
streams,</item>
        <item>And fruits of their desire.</item>
        <item>It will be said to them, “Eat and drink with pleasure
because of what you used to do.”</item>
        <item>This is how We reward those who do good deeds.</item>
        <item>Woe that Day to the deniers!</item>
        <item>O disbelievers, eat and drink for a while! You are
guilty ones.”</item>
        <item>Woe that Day to the deniers!</item>
        <item>And when it is said to them, “Bow down (i.e. submit to
Allah’s commands)”, they do not bow down.</item>
        <item>Woe that Day to the deniers!</item>
        <item>Now, in which discourse, after this, will they believe?
</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>About what are they asking each other?</item>
        <item>About the Great Event</item>
        <item>In which they dispute! ¹</item>
        <item>Indeed they will soon know.</item>
        <item>Again, indeed they will soon know.</item>
        <item>Did We not make the earth a floor,</item>
        <item>And the mountains bulwarks?</item>
        <item>And We have created you in pairs,</item>
        <item>And made your sleep a source of rest,</item>
        <item>And made the night a covering,</item>
        <item>And made the day a source of livelihood.</item>
        <item>And We have built seven strong (skies),</item>
        <item>And created a luminous lamp (the sun).</item>
        <item>And We have sent down abundant water from the rain-laden
clouds,</item>
        <item>So that We bring out therewith grain and vegetation,
</item>
        <item>And thick gardens.</item>
        <item>Surely the Day of Decision is an appointed time,</item>
        <item>A day when the trumpet will be blown, so you will come
in multitudes,</item>
        <item>And the sky will be opened, so it will become as gates,
</item>
        <item>And the mountains will be set in motion, so they will be
as mirage.</item>
        <item>Surely Jahannam (the Hell) lurks in ambush.</item>
        <item>It is abode for the rebellious people</item>
        <item>Who will be abiding in it for ages.</item>
        <item>They will taste nothing cool in it, nor a drink,</item>
        <item>Except boiling water and pus</item>
        <item>This being a punishment, fully commensurate (with their
deeds).</item>
        <item>They did not expect (to face) accounting (of their
deeds),</item>
        <item>And they rejected Our signs totally.</item>
        <item>And everything (from their deeds) is thoroughly recorded
by Us in writing.</item>
        <item>So now taste! We will add nothing to you but
torment.”</item>
        <item>Of course, the God-fearing will have great achievement,
</item>
        <item>Gardens and grapes,</item>
        <item>And buxom maidens of matching age,</item>
        <item>And goblets filled up to the brim.</item>
        <item>They will not hear any vain talk therein, nor lies,
</item>
        <item>This being a reward from their Lord, a well calculated
grant,</item>
        <item>From) the Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is
between them, the All-Merciful. No one will have power to address Him,
</item>
        <item>On the Day when the Spirit ²nd the angels will stand in
rows. They will not speak, except the one who is permitted by the
Rahman (the All-Merciful Allah) and speaks aright.</item>
        <item>That is the Day that is sure to come. So whoever so
wishes may take refuge with his Lord.</item>
        <item>We have warned you of an approaching torment (that will
be inflicted) on a day when one will see what his hands have sent
ahead, and the disbeliever will say, “O would that I had turned into
dust.”</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>I swear by those (angels) who pull out (the souls of the
infidels) with extreme force, ¹</item>
        <item>And by those (angels) who untie the knot (of the souls
of the believers) smoothly,</item>
        <item>And by those who float (in the atmosphere) swiftly,
</item>
        <item>Then proceed forward quickly,</item>
        <item>Then manage (to do) everything (they are ordered to do,)
</item>
        <item>You will be resurrected) on the Day when the shocking
event (i.e. the first blowing of the trumpet) will shock (everything),
</item>
        <item>Followed by the next one (i.e. the second blowing of the
trumpet.) ²</item>
        <item>On that day, hearts (of people) will be throbbing,
</item>
        <item>With their eyes downcast.</item>
        <item>They (the infidels) say, “Are we going to be brought
back to our former state (of Life)?</item>
        <item>Is it when we are turned into decayed bones?”</item>
        <item>They say, “If so, that will be a harmful homecoming.”
³</item>
        <item>In fact, it will be only a single harsh voice,</item>
        <item>And in no time they will be (brought) into the plain (of
hashr).</item>
        <item>Has there come to you the narrative about Musa?</item>
        <item>Recall) when his Lord called to him in the blessed
valley of Tuwa:</item>
        <item>Go to Fir‘aun (Pharaoh). Indeed, he has crossed all
bounds.</item>
        <item>And say (to him,) ‘Would you like to purify yourself,
</item>
        <item>And that I should guide you to your Lord, so that you
fear (Him)?’”</item>
        <item>So, he (Musa) showed him the biggest sign.</item>
        <item>But he rejected and disobeyed,</item>
        <item>Then he turned back, and tried hard (to refute the
Messenger),</item>
        <item>Then he gathered (his people) and shouted</item>
        <item>And said, “I am your supreme lord.”</item>
        <item>So, Allah seized him for an exemplary punishment in the
Hereafter and the present world.</item>
        <item>Indeed, there is a lesson for him who fears (Allah).
</item>
        <item>Is your creation more difficult or that of the sky? ⁴He
has built it,</item>
        <item>He has raised its height, then made it proper,</item>
        <item>And darkened its night, and brought forth its daylight,
</item>
        <item>And, after that, He spread out the earth.</item>
        <item>From it, He brought out its water and its meadows,
</item>
        <item>And firmly fixed the mountains,</item>
        <item>All this) as a benefit to you and your cattle.</item>
        <item>So when the Greatest Havoc will take place</item>
        <item>On the day when man will recall what he did,</item>
        <item>And the Hell will be exposed for all who see,</item>
        <item>Then for the one who had rebelled,</item>
        <item>And preferred the worldly life (to the Hereafter),
</item>
        <item>The Hell will be the abode,</item>
        <item>Whereas for the one who feared to stand before his Lord,
and restrained his self from the (evil) desire,</item>
        <item>The Paradise will be the abode.</item>
        <item>They ask you (O Prophet,) about the Hour (the Day of
Judgment) as to when it will take place.</item>
        <item>In which capacity are you to tell this?</item>
        <item>With your Lord is the final word about it.</item>
        <item>You are only a warner for anyone who fears it.</item>
        <item>The day they will see it, it will seem to them as if
they did not live (in the world) but only for one afternoon or for the
morning thereof.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>He (the Prophet) frowned and turned his face,</item>
        <item>Because the blind man came to him! ¹</item>
        <item>What could tell you (O prophet about the prospects of
the blind man?) May be, (if you had attended him properly,) he would
have attained purity,</item>
        <item>Or have received the advice, and the advice would have
benefited him.</item>
        <item>As for the one who does not care (about faith),</item>
        <item>You are anxious to pursue him,</item>
        <item>While there is no blame on you, if he does not attain
purity.</item>
        <item>As regards the one who has come to you rushing eagerly,
</item>
        <item>While he fears (Allah),</item>
        <item>To him you pay no heed!</item>
        <item>Never! (you should never act in this way,) Indeed this
(Qur’an) is an advice.</item>
        <item>So, whoever so wills may pay heed to it.</item>
        <item>It is (recorded) in those scripts (of the Preserved
Tablet) that are honoured,</item>
        <item>Exalted, purified,</item>
        <item>In the hands of those scribes</item>
        <item>Who are honorable, righteous.</item>
        <item>Damned is the man! ²How ungrateful he is!</item>
        <item>From which stuff did He (Allah) create him?</item>
        <item>From a drop of semen! He created him, and designed him
in due proportion,</item>
        <item>Then He made the way easy for him, ³</item>
        <item>Later, he made him die, and put him into grave,</item>
        <item>Thereafter, when He will intend, He will raise him up.
</item>
        <item>No! He has not yet fulfilled what He (Allah) had
commanded him.</item>
        <item>So, the man should consider his food,</item>
        <item>How well We poured water,</item>
        <item>Then how nicely We split the earth,</item>
        <item>Then We grew in it grain,</item>
        <item>And grapes and greens,</item>
        <item>And olive and date-palms,</item>
        <item>And gardens, full of thick trees,</item>
        <item>And fruits and fodder,</item>
        <item>As a benefit for you and your cattle.</item>
        <item>So when the Deafening Noise will occur, ⁴</item>
        <item>The Day when one will flee from his brother,</item>
        <item>And from his mother and father,</item>
        <item>And from his wife and sons,</item>
        <item>Every one of them will be too engaged in his own affairs
to care for others.</item>
        <item>Many faces, on that day, will be bright,</item>
        <item>Laughing, rejoicing,</item>
        <item>And many faces, on that day, will be stained with dust,
</item>
        <item>Covered by darkness.</item>
        <item>Those are the disbelievers, the nefarious.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>When the sun will be folded up, ¹</item>
        <item>And when the stars will swoop down,</item>
        <item>And when the mountains will be set in motion,</item>
        <item>And when the ten-months pregnant she-camels will be
abandoned, ²</item>
        <item>And when the wild beasts will be gathered together,
³</item>
        <item>And when the seas will be flared up, ⁴</item>
        <item>And when the people will be arranged in categories,
</item>
        <item>And when the girl-child that was buried alive will be
asked,</item>
        <item>For what sin she was killed, ⁵</item>
        <item>And when the scrolls (of deeds) will be unrolled,</item>
        <item>And when the sky will be stripped off,</item>
        <item>And when the Hell will be set ablaze,</item>
        <item>And when the Paradise will be brought close,</item>
        <item>Then everyone will know what he (or she) has put
forward.</item>
        <item>So, I swear by those (stars) that recede,</item>
        <item>That proceed, that withdraw from the scene, ⁶</item>
        <item>And by the night when it departs,</item>
        <item>And the morning when it starts breathing,</item>
        <item>It (the Qur’an) is surely the word of a noble messenger
(Jibra’il (A.S)),</item>
        <item>The one possessing power and a high status with the Lord
of the Throne,</item>
        <item>The one obeyed there, trusted.</item>
        <item>Your companion (Muhammad ) is not a madman,</item>
        <item>And he did see him (Jibra’il (A.S)) on the clear
horizon. ⁷</item>
        <item>And he (the Prophet) is not stingy about (the news of)
the unseen. ⁸</item>
        <item>Nor is it the word of an outcast satan (devil).</item>
        <item>Then where are you going?</item>
        <item>It is nothing else but a message of advice for all the
worlds,</item>
        <item>For the benefit of any one from among you who intends to
go straight.</item>
        <item>And you cannot intend (to do anything) unless it is so
willed by Allah, the Lord of all the worlds. ⁹</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>When the sky will be cleft asunder,</item>
        <item>And when the stars will disperse,</item>
        <item>And when the seas will be burst forth,</item>
        <item>And when the graves will be overturned,</item>
        <item>Then one will know what he sent ahead and what he left
behind. ¹</item>
        <item>O man! What has deceived you about your Gracious Lord,
</item>
        <item>Who created you, then perfected you, then brought you in
due proportion?</item>
        <item>He composed you in whichever form He willed.</item>
        <item>Never! (i.e. one should never be heedless towards him.)
But you deny the Requital,</item>
        <item>While (appointed) over you there are watchers, ²</item>
        <item>Who are noble, writers (of the deeds),</item>
        <item>Who know whatever you do.</item>
        <item>Surely the righteous will be in bliss,</item>
        <item>And the sinners in Hell,</item>
        <item>In which they will enter on the Day of Requital,</item>
        <item>And they will not (be able to) keep away from it.</item>
        <item>And what may let you know what the Day of Requital is?
</item>
        <item>Again, what may let you know what the Day of Requital
is?</item>
        <item>A Day when no one will have power to do any thing for
another! And command, on that Day, will belong to Allah (alone).
³</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Woe to the curtailers</item>
        <item>Who, when they measure something to receive from people,
take it in full,</item>
        <item>And when they measure or weigh something to give it to
them, give less than due. ¹</item>
        <item>Do they not think that they have to be raised up</item>
        <item>On a Great Day,</item>
        <item>The Day when all the people will stand before the Lord
of the worlds?</item>
        <item>Never! (i.e. they should never act in such a way.)
Indeed the record of deeds of the sinners is in Sijjin . ²</item>
        <item>And what may let you know what Sijjin is?</item>
        <item>A register, inscribed! ³</item>
        <item>Woe that day to the deniers,</item>
        <item>Who deny the Day of Requital!</item>
        <item>And none denies it but every sinful transgressor.</item>
        <item>When Our verses are recited to him, he says, “(These
are) tales of the ancients.”</item>
        <item>No! But that which they used to commit has covered their
hearts with rust.</item>
        <item>No! Indeed they will be screened off from their Lord on
that Day.</item>
        <item>Then they will have to enter the Hell.</item>
        <item>Then it will be said, “This is what you used to
deny.”</item>
        <item>No! The record of deeds of the righteous is in ‘Illiyyun
. ⁴</item>
        <item>And what may let you know what ‘Illiyyun is ?</item>
        <item>A register inscribed,</item>
        <item>Attended by those (angels) who are blessed with nearness
to Allah!</item>
        <item>Indeed the righteous will be in absolute bliss.</item>
        <item>While (sitting) on thrones they will be watching (the
scenes of Paradise).</item>
        <item>You will recognize the glamour of bliss on their faces.
</item>
        <item>They will be served with a pure sealed wine to drink,
</item>
        <item>The seal of which will be of musk.___It is this (bliss)
in aspiring for which the competitors should race each other.</item>
        <item>And it will be blended with (a drink from) Tasnim ,
</item>
        <item>A spring from which will drink those who are blessed
with nearness.</item>
        <item>Indeed those who were guilty used to laugh at those who
believed,</item>
        <item>And when they passed by them, they used to wink at one
another,</item>
        <item>And when they went back to their family, they went
enjoying their mockery,</item>
        <item>And when they saw them, they said, “Surely these are the
ones who have gone astray”</item>
        <item>While they were not sent as watchmen over them.</item>
        <item>So, today those who believed will laugh at the
disbelievers.</item>
        <item>While (sitting) on thrones, they will be seeing</item>
        <item>Whether the disbelievers have been paid back for what
they used to do.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>When the sky will split apart,</item>
        <item>And will listen to (the command of) its Lord,__ and it
ought to,__</item>
        <item>And when the earth will be stretched (to give room to
more people), ¹</item>
        <item>And it will throw up whatever it contains, and will
become empty, ²</item>
        <item>And will listen to (the command of) its Lord,__ and it
ought to,__ (then man will see the consequences of his deeds.)</item>
        <item>O man, you have to work hard constantly to reach your
Lord, and then you have to meet Him.</item>
        <item>So, as for him whose book (of deeds) will be given to
him in his right hand,</item>
        <item>He will be called to account in an easy manner,</item>
        <item>And he will go back to his people joyfully.</item>
        <item>As for the one whose book (of deeds) will be given to
him from his backside, ³</item>
        <item>He will pray for death,</item>
        <item>And will enter the blazing fire.</item>
        <item>He had been joyful among his people (in the world).
</item>
        <item>He thought he would never revert (to Allah).</item>
        <item>No! Indeed his Lord was watchful over him.</item>
        <item>So, I swear by the twilight (after sunset),</item>
        <item>And by the night and what it envelops,</item>
        <item>And by the moon when it develops at the full,</item>
        <item>You shall certainly ascend from stage to stage. ⁴</item>
        <item>So, what is wrong with them that they do not believe,
</item>
        <item>And when the Qur’an is recited to them, they do not
offer sajdah (prostration)? ⁵</item>
        <item>Rather, those who disbelieve deny (the truth).</item>
        <item>And Allah is most aware of what they store. ⁶</item>
        <item>So, give him the ‘good news’ of a painful punishment,
</item>
        <item>But those who believed and did righteous deeds will have
a reward that will never be interrupted. ⁷</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>I swear by the sky, the one having stellar formations,
¹</item>
        <item>And by the Promised Day, ²</item>
        <item>And by that which attends, and that which is attended,
³</item>
        <item>Cursed were the People of the Trench, ⁴</item>
        <item>The (people of the) fire that was rich with fuel,</item>
        <item>When they were sitting by it,</item>
        <item>And were watching what they were doing with the
believers.</item>
        <item>They punished them for nothing but that they believed in
Allah, the All-Mighty, the Worthy of All Praise,</item>
        <item>The One to whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and
the earth. And Allah is witness over every thing.</item>
        <item>Surely, those who persecuted the believing men and the
believing women, then did not repent, __for them there is the torment
of Jahannam (Hell), and for them there is the torment of burning.
</item>
        <item>As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, for
them there are gardens beneath which rivers flow. That is the big
achievement.</item>
        <item>The seizure of your Lord is severe indeed!</item>
        <item>Surely He originates (creation) and repeats (it after
death).</item>
        <item>And He is the Most-Forgiving, the Most-Loving,</item>
        <item>The Master of the Throne, the Glorious.</item>
        <item>He is ever doer of what He intends.</item>
        <item>Has there come to you the story of the forces,</item>
        <item>Of Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and Thamud?</item>
        <item>But those who disbelieve are (engaged) in denying (the
truth).</item>
        <item>Allah has encompassed them from all sides.</item>
        <item>The reality is that it is the glorious Qur’an,</item>
        <item>Recorded) in the Preserved Tablet (Lauh Mahfuz).</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>I swear by the sky and by the Night-Comer,__</item>
        <item>And what may let you know what the Night-Comer is?
</item>
        <item>The star of piercing brightness!_ ¹ _</item>
        <item>There is no human being, but there is a watcher over
him.</item>
        <item>So, let man consider of which stuff he is created.
</item>
        <item>He is created of spouting water</item>
        <item>That comes out from between the loins and the chestbones. ²</item>
        <item>Surely He is Powerful to bring him back</item>
        <item>On a day when all the secrets will be searched out,
³</item>
        <item>And he will have neither strength (to defend), nor a
supporter.</item>
        <item>I swear by the sky that rains,</item>
        <item>And the earth that cracks open (for plants),</item>
        <item>This is a decisive word,</item>
        <item>And it is not a joke.</item>
        <item>They are devising plans,</item>
        <item>And I Am devising plans.</item>
        <item>So leave the disbelievers alone at the moment; give them
respite for a while. ⁴</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Pronounce the purity of the name of your most exalted
Lord,</item>
        <item>Who created (everything), then made (it) well,</item>
        <item>And who determined a measure (for everything), then
guided (it), ¹</item>
        <item>And who brought forth pasturage,</item>
        <item>Then turned it into a blackening stubble. ²</item>
        <item>We will make you recite, then you will not forget</item>
        <item>Except that which Allah wills. ³Indeed He knows what is
manifest and what is hidden.</item>
        <item>And We will facilitate for you (to reach) the easiest
way. ⁴</item>
        <item>So, extend advice (to people) if advice is useful.
⁵</item>
        <item>The one who fears (Allah) will observe the advice,
</item>
        <item>And it will be avoided by the most wretched one</item>
        <item>Who will enter the Biggest Fire,</item>
        <item>Then he will neither die therein, nor live (a desirable
life).</item>
        <item>Success is surely achieved by him who purifies himself,
</item>
        <item>And pronounces the name of his Lord, then offers prayer.
</item>
        <item>But you prefer the worldly life,</item>
        <item>While the Hereafter is much better and much more
durable.</item>
        <item>Indeed this is (written) in the earlier divine scripts,
</item>
        <item>The scripts of Ibrahim and Musa.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Has there come to you the description of the
Overwhelming Event?</item>
        <item>Many faces that day will be humbled,</item>
        <item>Laboring, exhausted.</item>
        <item>They will enter into the scorching fire.</item>
        <item>They will be made to drink water from a boiling spring.
</item>
        <item>There will be no food for them except from a thorny
plant</item>
        <item>That will neither nourish, nor satisfy hunger.</item>
        <item>Many faces that day will be full of glamour,</item>
        <item>Well pleased with their endeavor,</item>
        <item>In a lofty garden,</item>
        <item>In which they will not hear any absurd talk.</item>
        <item>In it there is a flowing spring.</item>
        <item>In it there are elevated couches</item>
        <item>And goblets, well placed,</item>
        <item>And cushions, arrayed</item>
        <item>And carpets, spread around.</item>
        <item>So, do they not look at the camels how they are created,
¹</item>
        <item>And at the sky, how it is raised high,</item>
        <item>And at the mountains, how they are installed,</item>
        <item>And at the earth, how it is spread out?</item>
        <item>So, (O Prophet,) keep on preaching; you are only a
preacher.</item>
        <item>You are not a taskmaster set up over them,</item>
        <item>But whoever turns away and disbelieves,</item>
        <item>Allah will punish him with the greatest torment.</item>
        <item>Surely towards Us they have to return,</item>
        <item>Then it is Our job to call them to account.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>I swear by the dawn,</item>
        <item>And by Ten Nights, ¹</item>
        <item>And by the even and the odd, ²</item>
        <item>And by the night when it moves away,</item>
        <item>Is there (not) in such an oath (enough assurance) for a
man of sense?__</item>
        <item>Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with (the people)
of ‘Ad</item>
        <item>Of Iram , the men of tall pillars,</item>
        <item>The like of whom were never created in the lands,
³</item>
        <item>And (how He dealt) with (the people of) Thamud who had
carved out the rocks in the Valley (of Qura),</item>
        <item>And with Fir‘aun (Pharaoh), the man of the stakes,
⁴</item>
        <item>Those who had rebelled in the cities,</item>
        <item>And spread a lot of mischief therein.</item>
        <item>So, your Lord let loose on them the whip of torment.
</item>
        <item>Surely your Lord is ever on the watch.</item>
        <item>As for man, when his Lord tests him, and thus gives him
honour and bounties, he says, “My Lord has honoured me.”</item>
        <item>But when he tests him, and thus straitens his provision
for him, he says, “My Lord has disgraced me.”</item>
        <item>No! But you do not honour the orphan,</item>
        <item>And do not encourage one another to feed the needy.
</item>
        <item>And you devour the inheritance with a sweeping gulp,
</item>
        <item>And love wealth, an excessive love.</item>
        <item>No! When the earth will be crushed thoroughly to be
turned into bits,</item>
        <item>And your Lord will come, ⁵and the angels as well, lined
up in rows,</item>
        <item>And Jahannam (Hell), on that day, will be brought
forward, it will be the day when man will realize the truth, but from
where will he take advantage of such realization?</item>
        <item>He will say, “O Would that I had sent ahead (some good
deeds) for (this) my life!”</item>
        <item>So no one can punish like He will punish, that day,
</item>
        <item>Nor can anyone shackle like He will shackle.</item>
        <item>As for an obedient man, it will be said to him,) “O
content soul,</item>
        <item>Come back to your Lord, well-pleased, well-pleasing.
⁶</item>
        <item>So, enter among My (special) servants,</item>
        <item>And enter My Paradise.”</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>I swear by this city,</item>
        <item>And (O Prophet,) you are going to be allowed (to fight)
in this city__ ¹</item>
        <item>And by the father and all those he begot, ²</item>
        <item>Indeed We have created man (to live) in hard struggle.
³</item>
        <item>Does he think that no one has power over him?</item>
        <item>He says, “I have spent a lot of wealth.” ⁴</item>
        <item>Does he think that no one has seen him?</item>
        <item>Did We not make for him two eyes,</item>
        <item>And one tongue and two lips,</item>
        <item>And showed him the two ways?</item>
        <item>Yet he did not make his way through the steep course,_
⁵__</item>
        <item>And what may let you know what the steep course is?
</item>
        <item>It is) freeing of the neck of a slave,</item>
        <item>Or giving food in a day of hunger</item>
        <item>To an orphan near of kin,</item>
        <item>Or to a needy person lying in dust_⁶__</item>
        <item>Then he did join those who believe and advise each other
to be patient and advise each other to be merciful.</item>
        <item>Those are the People of the Right Hand. (i.e. their
books of deeds will be given in their right hands)</item>
        <item>As for those who reject Our verses, they are the People
of the Left Hand. (i.e. their books of deeds will be given in their
left hands.)</item>
        <item>Upon them will be the Fire, enveloping them with closed
exits.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>I swear by the sun and his broad light,</item>
        <item>And by the moon when she follows him,</item>
        <item>And by the day when it shows his brightness,</item>
        <item>And by the night when it envelops him,</item>
        <item>And by the sky, and the One who built it,</item>
        <item>And by the earth, and the One who spread it,</item>
        <item>And by the soul, and the One who made it well,</item>
        <item>Then inspired it with its (instincts of) evil and piety,
¹</item>
        <item>Success is really attained by him who purifies it,
</item>
        <item>And failure is really suffered by him who pollutes it.
</item>
        <item>The People of) Thamud denied the truth because of their
transgression,</item>
        <item>When rose up the one who was most wretched of them.
</item>
        <item>So, the Messenger of Allah said to them, “Be careful of
Allah’s she-camel and her right to drink.”</item>
        <item>But they rejected him and killed her, so their Lord sent
eradicating torment upon them because of their sin, and made it equal
for all. ²</item>
        <item>And He has no fear of its consequence.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>I swear by the night when it covers (the sun),</item>
        <item>And by the day when it unveils itself,</item>
        <item>And by the One who created the male and the female,
</item>
        <item>Your efforts are diverse:</item>
        <item>As for the one who gives (in charity) and fears Allah,
</item>
        <item>And believes in the best (religion),</item>
        <item>We will facilitate for him the way to extreme ease (i.e.
the comforts of Paradise). ¹</item>
        <item>But the one who is miser and deems himself selfsufficient,</item>
        <item>And rejects the best (religion),</item>
        <item>We will facilitate for him the way to extreme distress.
</item>
        <item>And his wealth will not help him when he will fall down
(into Hell).</item>
        <item>Of course, it is undertaken by Us to guide,</item>
        <item>And in Our control is the Hereafter and the worldly
life.</item>
        <item>So I have warned you of a blazing fire.</item>
        <item>None will enter it but the wretched one,</item>
        <item>Who rejected (the truth) and turned away (from it).
</item>
        <item>And saved from it will be the most God-fearing one,
</item>
        <item>Who gives his wealth (in charity) to become purified,
²</item>
        <item>While no one has conferred any favour on him for which
he would give a return,</item>
        <item>But (he gave his wealth in charity) only to seek the
Countenance of his Lord, ³the Most High.</item>
        <item>And surely he will soon be happy.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>I swear by the forenoon,</item>
        <item>And by the night when it becomes peaceful,</item>
        <item>Your Lord (O Prophet,) has neither forsaken you, nor has
become displeased. ¹</item>
        <item>Surely the Hereafter is much better for you than the
present life.</item>
        <item>And of course, your Lord will give you so much that you
will be pleased. ²</item>
        <item>Did He not find you an orphan, and give you shelter?
</item>
        <item>And He found you unaware of the way (the Shari‘ah ),
then He guided you.</item>
        <item>And He found you in need, then made you need-free.
</item>
        <item>Therefore, as for orphan, do not oppress him,</item>
        <item>And as for the beggar, do not scold him.</item>
        <item>And about the bounty of your Lord, do talk. ³</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Have We not caused your bosom to be wide open for you?
¹</item>
        <item>And We removed from you your burden</item>
        <item>That had (almost) broken your back, ²</item>
        <item>And We raised high your name. ³</item>
        <item>So, undoubtedly, along with the hardship there is ease.
</item>
        <item>Undoubtedly, along with the hardship there is ease.
⁴</item>
        <item>So, when you are free (from collective services), toil
hard (in worship), ⁵</item>
        <item>And towards your Lord turn with eagerness.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>I swear by the Fig and the Olive,</item>
        <item>And by Tur, the mount of Sinai,</item>
        <item>And by this peaceful city, ¹</item>
        <item>We have created man in the best composition,</item>
        <item>Then We turned him into the lowest of the low, ²</item>
        <item>Except those who believed and did righteous deeds,
because for them there is a reward never ending. ³</item>
        <item>So, what can make you, after all this, to deny the
Requital?</item>
        <item>Is Allah not the Greatest Ruler of all the rulers?
⁴</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Read with the name of your Lord who created (every
thing),</item>
        <item>He created man from a clot of blood.</item>
        <item>Read, and your Lord is the most gracious,</item>
        <item>Who imparted knowledge by means of the pen.</item>
        <item>He taught man what he did not know. ¹</item>
        <item>In fact, man crosses the limits,</item>
        <item>Because he deems himself to be free of need. ²</item>
        <item>Surely to your Lord is the return.</item>
        <item>Have you seen him who forbids</item>
        <item>A servant of Allah when he prays?</item>
        <item>Tell me, if he is on the right path,</item>
        <item>Or bids piety, (would the former still forbid him?)
</item>
        <item>Tell me, if he rejects (the true faith) and turns away,
</item>
        <item>Does he not know that Allah is watching (him)?</item>
        <item>No! If he does not desist, We will certainly drag (him)
by forelock,</item>
        <item>A lying, sinful forelock.</item>
        <item>So let him call the men of his council,</item>
        <item>We will call the soldiers of the Hell. ³</item>
        <item>No! Never obey him, and bow down in sajdah, and come
close to Me. ⁴</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>We have sent it (the Qur’an) down in the Night of Qadr.
¹</item>
        <item>And what may let you know what the Night of Qadr is?
</item>
        <item>The Night of Qadr is much better than one thousand
months.</item>
        <item>The angels and the Spirit descend in it, with the leave
of your Lord, along with every command. ²</item>
        <item>Peace it is till the debut of dawn.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Those who disbelieved from among the People of the Book
and the polytheists were not (expected) to desist (from their wrong
beliefs) unless there comes to them a clear proof,</item>
        <item>A messenger from Allah who recites the purified
scrolls</item>
        <item>Containing (right and) straight writings.</item>
        <item>And those who were given the Book did not disagree but
after the clear proof came to them, ¹</item>
        <item>While they were not ordered but to worship Allah, making
their submission exclusive for him with no deviation, and to establish
Salah and pay Zakah . That is the way of the straight religion.</item>
        <item>Surely those who disbelieved from among the People of
the Book and the polytheists will be in the fire of Jahannam , in
which they will be living forever. Those are the worst of all human
beings.</item>
        <item>As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, they
are the best of all human beings.</item>
        <item>Their reward, with their Lord, is gardens of eternity
beneath which rivers flow, in which they will be abiding forever.
Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him.
That (reward) is for him who has awe of his Lord.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>When the earth will be trembled with its quake,</item>
        <item>And the earth will bring forth its burdens, ¹</item>
        <item>And man will say, “What has happened to it?”</item>
        <item>That day it will describe all its happenings, ²</item>
        <item>Because its Lord will have so commanded it.</item>
        <item>That day the people will come back (from the place of
reckoning) in different groups, so that they may be shown (the fruits
of) their deeds.</item>
        <item>So, whoever does any good act (even) to the weight of a
particle will see it.</item>
        <item>And whoever does evil (even) to the weight of a particle
will see it.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>I swear) by those (horses) that run snorting,</item>
        <item>Then those that create sparks by striking (their hoofs)
on the stones,</item>
        <item>Then those that invade at morning,</item>
        <item>Then raise, at the same time, a trail of dust,</item>
        <item>Then enter, at the same time, into the centre of the
(opposing) host,</item>
        <item>Man is, indeed, very ungrateful to his Lord, ¹</item>
        <item>And he himself is a witness to that fact,</item>
        <item>And in his love for wealth, he is very intense.</item>
        <item>Does he not then know (what will happen) when all that
is contained in the graves will be overturned,</item>
        <item>And all that is contained in the hearts will be exposed.
²</item>
        <item>Surely your Lord, that day, is fully aware of them.
</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>The Striking Event!</item>
        <item>What is the Striking Event?</item>
        <item>And what may let you know what the Striking Event is?
</item>
        <item>It will happen) on a day when people will be like
scattered moths,</item>
        <item>And the mountains will be like carded wool.</item>
        <item>Then, as for him whose scales (of good deeds) are heavy,
</item>
        <item>He will be in a happy life.</item>
        <item>But he whose scales are light,</item>
        <item>His abode will be Abyss.</item>
        <item>And what may let you know what that (Abyss) is?</item>
        <item>A blazing Fire!</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>You are distracted by mutual competition in amassing
(worldly benefits),</item>
        <item>Until you reach the graves.</item>
        <item>No! (This is not a correct attitude.) You will soon know
(the reality).</item>
        <item>Again, you will soon know.</item>
        <item>No! Only if you knew (it) with a sure knowledge!</item>
        <item>You will certainly see the Hell,</item>
        <item>Then you will see it with full certitude.</item>
        <item>Then you will be asked about all the pleasures (you
enjoyed in the world).</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>I swear) by the Time,</item>
        <item>Man is in a state of loss indeed, ¹</item>
        <item>Except those who believed and did righteous deeds, and
exhorted each other to follow truth, and exhorted each other to
observe patience. ²</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Woe to every backbiter, derider ¹</item>
        <item>Who accumulates wealth and counts it. ²</item>
        <item>He thinks that his wealth has made him eternal.</item>
        <item>Never! He will certainly be thrown into the Crushing
Fire.</item>
        <item>And what may let you know what the Crushing Fire is?
</item>
        <item>It is Allah’s kindled fire</item>
        <item>That will peep into the hearts.</item>
        <item>It will be closed on them,</item>
        <item>In outstretched columns.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the People of
the Elephant? ¹</item>
        <item>Has He not turned their plan into nullity?</item>
        <item>And He sent upon them flying birds in flocks,</item>
        <item>Throwing upon them stones of baked clay,</item>
        <item>And thus He turned them into an eaten-up chaff.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Because of the familiarity of the Quraish,</item>
        <item>That is, their familiarity with the trips of winter and
summer,</item>
        <item>They must worship the Lord of this House, ¹</item>
        <item>Who gave them food against hunger, and gave them
security against fear.</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Have you seen him who denies the Requital?</item>
        <item>So, he is the one who pushes away the orphan,</item>
        <item>And does not persuade (others) to feed the needy.
¹</item>
        <item>So, Woe to those performers of Salah ,</item>
        <item>Who are neglectful of their Salah, ²</item>
        <item>Who (do good only to) show off,</item>
        <item>And refuse (to give even) small gifts. ³</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>O Prophet,) surely We have given to you Al-Kauthar.
¹</item>
        <item>So, offer Salah (prayer) to your Lord, and sacrifice.
²</item>
        <item>Surely it is your enemy whose traces are cut off.
³</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Say, “O disbelievers,</item>
        <item>I do not worship that which you worship,</item>
        <item>Nor do you worship the One whom I worship. ¹</item>
        <item>And neither I am going to worship that which you have
worshipped, ²</item>
        <item>Nor will you worship the One whom I worship.</item>
        <item>For you is your faith, and for me, my faith.” ³</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>O Prophet,) When there comes Allah’s help and the
Victory,</item>
        <item>And you see people entering Allah’s (approved) religion
in multitudes,</item>
        <item>Then pronounce the purity and praise of your Lord, and
seek forgiveness from Him. Surely He is Ever-Relenting. ¹</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab, and perish he!
¹</item>
        <item>Neither his wealth benefited him, nor what he earned.
²</item>
        <item>He will soon enter a Fire, full of flames,</item>
        <item>And his wife as well,__the wicked ³carrier of firewood.
⁴</item>
        <item>Around her neck, there is (a collar of iron, like) a
well-twisted rope. ⁵</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Say, “The truth is that Allah is One. ¹</item>
        <item>Allah is Besought of all, needing none. ²</item>
        <item>He neither begot anyone, nor was he begotten.</item>
        <item>And equal to Him has never been any one.”</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
</item>
        <item>Say, “I seek refuge with the Lord of the daybreak</item>
        <item>From the evil of everything He has created, ¹</item>
        <item>And from the evil of the dark night when it penetrates,
²</item>
        <item>And from the evil of the women who blow on the knots,
³</item>
        <item>And from the evil of an envier when he envies. ⁴</item>
        <item>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.

        <item>The King of mankind,</item>
        <item>The God of mankind,</item>
